Doug Lea malloc(dlmalloc) linux默认malloc内存分配器

exception handling代替error code，分离错误处理代码，增加可读性
Java，Python，C++，异常机制沿函数调用栈逆向搜索，直到遇到异常处理代码为止
C 无异常处理机制，C++用raise抛出异常

COLORS-Lscolors

Set different colours for different kinds of files when using the ls command.

Add to ~/.bashrc:

alias ls='ls --color' //based on LS_COLORS
LS_COLORS='di=1:fi=0:ln=31:pi=5:so=5:bd=5:cd=5:or=31:mi=0:ex=35:*.rpm=90'
export LS_COLORS

The second line is the tricky one, and what I have worked out so far has been by trial and error.  
The parameters (di, fi, etc.) refer to different file types.

di = directory
fi = file
ln = symbolic link
pi = fifo file
so = socket file
bd = block (buffered) special file
cd = character (unbuffered) special file
or = symbolic link pointing to a non-existent file (orphan)
mi = non-existent file pointed to by a symbolic link (visible when you type ls -l)
ex = file which is executable (ie. has 'x' set in permissions).

The *.rpm=90 parameter at the end tells ls to display any files ending in .rpm in the specified colour, 
in this case colour 90 (dark grey). This can be applied to any types of files (eg. you could use '*.png=35' 
to make jpeg files appear purple.) As many or as few parameters as you like can go into the LS_COLORS variable, 
as long as the parameters are separated by colons.


0   = default colour
1   = bold
4   = underlined
5   = flashing text
7   = reverse field
31  = red
32  = green
33  = orange
34  = blue
35  = purple
36  = cyan
37  = grey
40  = black background
41  = red background
42  = green background
43  = orange background
44  = blue background
45  = purple background
46  = cyan background
47  = grey background
90  = dark grey
91  = light red
92  = light green
93  = yellow
94  = light blue
95  = light purple
96  = turquoise
100 = dark grey background
101 = light red background
102 = light green background
103 = yellow background
104 = light blue background
105 = light purple background
106 = turquoise background

These can be combined, so that a parameter like:
di=5;31;42
would make directories appear in flashing red text with a green background.

ANSI escape codes (or escape sequences) are a method using in-band 
signaling to control the formatting, color, and other output options 
on video text terminals.
