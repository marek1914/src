This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

This is Edition 0.70, last updated 1 April 2006,
of `The GNU Make Manual', for GNU `make' version 3.81.

<h3 class="section">14.6 Install Command Categories</h3>

<p><a name="index-pre_002dinstallation-commands-1013"></a><a name="index-post_002dinstallation-commands-1014"></a>When writing the <code>install</code> target, you must classify all the
commands into three categories: normal ones, <dfn>pre-installation</dfn>
commands and <dfn>post-installation</dfn> commands.

   <p>Normal commands move files into their proper places, and set their
modes.  They may not alter any files except the ones that come entirely
from the package they belong to.

   <p>Pre-installation and post-installation commands may alter other files;
in particular, they can edit global configuration files or data bases.

   <p>Pre-installation commands are typically executed before the normal
commands, and post-installation commands are typically run after the
normal commands.

   <p>The most common use for a post-installation command is to run
<code>install-info</code>.  This cannot be done with a normal command, since
it alters a file (the Info directory) which does not come entirely and
solely from the package being installed.  It is a post-installation
command because it needs to be done after the normal command which
installs the package's Info files.

   <p>Most programs don't need any pre-installation commands, but we have the
feature just in case it is needed.

   <p>To classify the commands in the <code>install</code> rule into these three
categories, insert <dfn>category lines</dfn> among them.  A category line
specifies the category for the commands that follow.

   <p>A category line consists of a tab and a reference to a special Make
variable, plus an optional comment at the end.  There are three
variables you can use, one for each category; the variable name
specifies the category.  Category lines are no-ops in ordinary execution
because these three Make variables are normally undefined (and you
<em>should not</em> define them in the makefile).

   <p>Here are the three possible category lines, each with a comment that
explains what it means:

<pre class="smallexample">             $(PRE_INSTALL)     # <span class="roman">Pre-install commands follow.</span>
             $(POST_INSTALL)    # <span class="roman">Post-install commands follow.</span>
             $(NORMAL_INSTALL)  # <span class="roman">Normal commands follow.</span>
</pre>
   <p>If you don't use a category line at the beginning of the <code>install</code>
rule, all the commands are classified as normal until the first category
line.  If you don't use any category lines, all the commands are
classified as normal.

   <p>These are the category lines for <code>uninstall</code>:

<pre class="smallexample">             $(PRE_UNINSTALL)     # <span class="roman">Pre-uninstall commands follow.</span>
             $(POST_UNINSTALL)    # <span class="roman">Post-uninstall commands follow.</span>
             $(NORMAL_UNINSTALL)  # <span class="roman">Normal commands follow.</span>
</pre>
   <p>Typically, a pre-uninstall command would be used for deleting entries
from the Info directory.

   <p>If the <code>install</code> or <code>uninstall</code> target has any dependencies
which act as subroutines of installation, then you should start
<em>each</em> dependency's commands with a category line, and start the
main target's commands with a category line also.  This way, you can
ensure that each command is placed in the right category regardless of
which of the dependencies actually run.

   <p>Pre-installation and post-installation commands should not run any
programs except for these:

<pre class="example">     [ basename bash cat chgrp chmod chown cmp cp dd diff echo
     egrep expand expr false fgrep find getopt grep gunzip gzip
     hostname install install-info kill ldconfig ln ls md5sum
     mkdir mkfifo mknod mv printenv pwd rm rmdir sed sort tee
     test touch true uname xargs yes
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-binary-packages-1015"></a>The reason for distinguishing the commands in this way is for the sake
of making binary packages.  Typically a binary package contains all the
executables and other files that need to be installed, and has its own
method of installing them&mdash;so it does not need to run the normal
installation commands.  But installing the binary package does need to
execute the pre-installation and post-installation commands.

   <p>Programs to build binary packages work by extracting the
pre-installation and post-installation commands.  Here is one way of
extracting the pre-installation commands (the <samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp> option to
<samp><span class="command">make</span></samp> is needed to silence messages about entering
subdirectories):

<pre class="smallexample">     make -s -n install -o all \
           PRE_INSTALL=pre-install \
           POST_INSTALL=post-install \
           NORMAL_INSTALL=normal-install \
       | gawk -f pre-install.awk
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">where the file <samp><span class="file">pre-install.awk</span></samp> could contain this:

<pre class="smallexample">     $0 ~ /^(normal-install|post-install)[ \t]*$/ {on = 0}
     on {print $0}
     $0 ~ /^pre-install[ \t]*$/ {on = 1}
</pre>
   </body></html>
