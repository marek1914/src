<h3 class="section">4.14 Generating Prerequisites Automatically</h3>

<p><a name="index-prerequisites_002c-automatic-generation-281"></a><a name="index-automatic-generation-of-prerequisites-282"></a><a name="index-generating-prerequisites-automatically-283"></a>
In the makefile for a program, many of the rules you need to write often
say only that some object file depends on some header
file.  For example, if <samp><span class="file">main.c</span></samp> uses <samp><span class="file">defs.h</span></samp> via an
<code>#include</code>, you would write:

<pre class="example">     main.o: defs.h
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">You need this rule so that <code>make</code> knows that it must remake
<samp><span class="file">main.o</span></samp> whenever <samp><span class="file">defs.h</span></samp> changes.  You can see that for a
large program you would have to write dozens of such rules in your
makefile.  And, you must always be very careful to update the makefile
every time you add or remove an <code>#include</code>. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0023include_007d-284"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002dM_007d-_0028to-compiler_0029-285"></a>To avoid this hassle, most modern C compilers can write these rules for
you, by looking at the <code>#include</code> lines in the source files. 
Usually this is done with the `<samp><span class="samp">-M</span></samp>' option to the compiler. 
For example, the command:

<pre class="example">     cc -M main.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">generates the output:

<pre class="example">     main.o : main.c defs.h
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Thus you no longer have to write all those rules yourself. 
The compiler will do it for you.

   <p>Note that such a prerequisite constitutes mentioning <samp><span class="file">main.o</span></samp> in a
makefile, so it can never be considered an intermediate file by implicit
rule search.  This means that <code>make</code> won't ever remove the file
after using it; see <a href="Chained-Rules.html#Chained-Rules">Chains of Implicit Rules</a>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bmake-depend_007d-286"></a>With old <code>make</code> programs, it was traditional practice to use this
compiler feature to generate prerequisites on demand with a command like
`<samp><span class="samp">make depend</span></samp>'.  That command would create a file <samp><span class="file">depend</span></samp>
containing all the automatically-generated prerequisites; then the
makefile could use <code>include</code> to read them in (see <a href="Include.html#Include">Include</a>).

   <p>In GNU <code>make</code>, the feature of remaking makefiles makes this
practice obsolete&mdash;you need never tell <code>make</code> explicitly to
regenerate the prerequisites, because it always regenerates any makefile
that is out of date.  See <a href="Remaking-Makefiles.html#Remaking-Makefiles">Remaking Makefiles</a>.

   <p>The practice we recommend for automatic prerequisite generation is to have
one makefile corresponding to each source file.  For each source file
<samp><var>name</var><span class="file">.c</span></samp> there is a makefile <samp><var>name</var><span class="file">.d</span></samp> which lists
what files the object file <samp><var>name</var><span class="file">.o</span></samp> depends on.  That way
only the source files that have changed need to be rescanned to produce
the new prerequisites.

   <p>Here is the pattern rule to generate a file of prerequisites (i.e., a makefile)
called <samp><var>name</var><span class="file">.d</span></samp> from a C source file called <samp><var>name</var><span class="file">.c</span></samp>:

<pre class="smallexample">     %.d: %.c
             @set -e; rm -f $@; \
              $(CC) -M $(CPPFLAGS) $&lt; &gt; $@.$$$$; \
              sed 's,\($*\)\.o[ :]*,\1.o $@ : ,g' &lt; $@.$$$$ &gt; $@; \
              rm -f $@.$$$$
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">See <a href="Pattern-Rules.html#Pattern-Rules">Pattern Rules</a>, for information on defining pattern rules.  The
`<samp><span class="samp">-e</span></samp>' flag to the shell causes it to exit immediately if the
<code>$(CC)</code> command (or any other command) fails (exits with a
nonzero status). 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002de_007d-_0028shell-flag_0029-287"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002dMM_007d-_0028to-GNU-compiler_0029-288"></a>With the GNU C compiler, you may wish to use the `<samp><span class="samp">-MM</span></samp>' flag instead
of `<samp><span class="samp">-M</span></samp>'.  This omits prerequisites on system header files. 
See <a href="../gcc/Preprocessor-Options.html#Preprocessor-Options">Options Controlling the Preprocessor</a>, for details.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007bsed_007d-_0028shell-command_0029-289"></a>The purpose of the <code>sed</code> command is to translate (for example):

<pre class="example">     main.o : main.c defs.h
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">into:

<pre class="example">     main.o main.d : main.c defs.h
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002ed_007d-290"></a>This makes each `<samp><span class="samp">.d</span></samp>' file depend on all the source and header files
that the corresponding `<samp><span class="samp">.o</span></samp>' file depends on.  <code>make</code> then
knows it must regenerate the prerequisites whenever any of the source or
header files changes.

   <p>Once you've defined the rule to remake the `<samp><span class="samp">.d</span></samp>' files,
you then use the <code>include</code> directive to read them all in. 
See <a href="Include.html#Include">Include</a>.  For example:

<pre class="example">     sources = foo.c bar.c
     
     include $(sources:.c=.d)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">(This example uses a substitution variable reference to translate the
list of source files `<samp><span class="samp">foo.c bar.c</span></samp>' into a list of prerequisite
makefiles, `<samp><span class="samp">foo.d bar.d</span></samp>'.  See <a href="Substitution-Refs.html#Substitution-Refs">Substitution Refs</a>, for full
information on substitution references.)  Since the `<samp><span class="samp">.d</span></samp>' files are
makefiles like any others, <code>make</code> will remake them as necessary
with no further work from you.  See <a href="Remaking-Makefiles.html#Remaking-Makefiles">Remaking Makefiles</a>.

   <p>Note that the `<samp><span class="samp">.d</span></samp>' files contain target definitions; you should
be sure to place the <code>include</code> directive <em>after</em> the first,
default goal in your makefiles or run the risk of having a random
object file become the default goal.
