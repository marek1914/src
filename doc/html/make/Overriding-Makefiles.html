This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

This is Edition 0.70, last updated 1 April 2006,
of `The GNU Make Manual', for GNU `make' version 3.81.

<h3 class="section">3.8 Overriding Part of Another Makefile</h3>

<p><a name="index-overriding-makefiles-105"></a><a name="index-makefile_002c-overriding-106"></a>Sometimes it is useful to have a makefile that is mostly just like
another makefile.  You can often use the `<samp><span class="samp">include</span></samp>' directive to
include one in the other, and add more targets or variable definitions. 
However, if the two makefiles give different commands for the same
target, <code>make</code> will not let you just do this.  But there is another way.

   <p><a name="index-match_002danything-rule_002c-used-to-override-107"></a>In the containing makefile (the one that wants to include the other),
you can use a match-anything pattern rule to say that to remake any
target that cannot be made from the information in the containing
makefile, <code>make</code> should look in another makefile. 
See <a href="Pattern-Rules.html#Pattern-Rules">Pattern Rules</a>, for more information on pattern rules.

   <p>For example, if you have a makefile called <samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> that says how
to make the target `<samp><span class="samp">foo</span></samp>' (and other targets), you can write a
makefile called <samp><span class="file">GNUmakefile</span></samp> that contains:

<pre class="example">     foo:
             frobnicate &gt; foo
     
     %: force
             @$(MAKE) -f Makefile $@
     force: ;
</pre>
   <p>If you say `<samp><span class="samp">make foo</span></samp>', <code>make</code> will find <samp><span class="file">GNUmakefile</span></samp>,
read it, and see that to make <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp>, it needs to run the command
`<samp><span class="samp">frobnicate &gt; foo</span></samp>'.  If you say `<samp><span class="samp">make bar</span></samp>', <code>make</code> will
find no way to make <samp><span class="file">bar</span></samp> in <samp><span class="file">GNUmakefile</span></samp>, so it will use the
commands from the pattern rule: `<samp><span class="samp">make -f Makefile bar</span></samp>'.  If
<samp><span class="file">Makefile</span></samp> provides a rule for updating <samp><span class="file">bar</span></samp>, <code>make</code>
will apply the rule.  And likewise for any other target that
<samp><span class="file">GNUmakefile</span></samp> does not say how to make.

   <p>The way this works is that the pattern rule has a pattern of just
`<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>', so it matches any target whatever.  The rule specifies a
prerequisite <samp><span class="file">force</span></samp>, to guarantee that the commands will be run even
if the target file already exists.  We give <samp><span class="file">force</span></samp> target empty
commands to prevent <code>make</code> from searching for an implicit rule to
build it&mdash;otherwise it would apply the same match-anything rule to
<samp><span class="file">force</span></samp> itself and create a prerequisite loop!
