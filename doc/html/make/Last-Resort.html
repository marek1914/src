automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

<h3 class="section">10.6 Defining Last-Resort Default Rules</h3>

<p><a name="index-last_002dresort-default-rules-972"></a><a name="index-default-rules_002c-last_002dresort-973"></a>
You can define a last-resort implicit rule by writing a terminal
match-anything pattern rule with no prerequisites (see <a href="Match_002dAnything-Rules.html#Match_002dAnything-Rules">Match-Anything Rules</a>).  This is just like any other pattern rule; the only thing
special about it is that it will match any target.  So such a rule's
commands are used for all targets and prerequisites that have no commands
of their own and for which no other implicit rule applies.

   <p>For example, when testing a makefile, you might not care if the source
files contain real data, only that they exist.  Then you might do this:

<pre class="example">     %::
             touch $@
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to cause all the source files needed (as prerequisites) to be created
automatically.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_002eDEFAULT-974"></a>You can instead define commands to be used for targets for which there
are no rules at all, even ones which don't specify commands.  You do
this by writing a rule for the target <code>.DEFAULT</code>.  Such a rule's
commands are used for all prerequisites which do not appear as targets in
any explicit rule, and for which no implicit rule applies.  Naturally,
there is no <code>.DEFAULT</code> rule unless you write one.

   <p>If you use <code>.DEFAULT</code> with no commands or prerequisites:

<pre class="example">     .DEFAULT:
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">the commands previously stored for <code>.DEFAULT</code> are cleared. 
Then <code>make</code> acts as if you had never defined <code>.DEFAULT</code> at all.

   <p>If you do not want a target to get the commands from a match-anything
pattern rule or <code>.DEFAULT</code>, but you also do not want any commands
to be run for the target, you can give it empty commands (see <a href="Empty-Commands.html#Empty-Commands">Defining Empty Commands</a>).

   <p>You can use a last-resort rule to override part of another makefile. 
See <a href="Overriding-Makefiles.html#Overriding-Makefiles">Overriding Part of Another Makefile</a>.
