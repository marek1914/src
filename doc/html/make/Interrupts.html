This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

This is Edition 0.70, last updated 1 April 2006,
of `The GNU Make Manual', for GNU `make' version 3.81.

<h3 class="section">5.6 Interrupting or Killing <code>make</code></h3>

<p><a name="index-interrupt-368"></a><a name="index-signal-369"></a><a name="index-deletion-of-target-files-370"></a><a name="index-removal-of-target-files-371"></a><a name="index-target_002c-deleting-on-interrupt-372"></a><a name="index-killing-_0028interruption_0029-373"></a>
If <code>make</code> gets a fatal signal while a command is executing, it may
delete the target file that the command was supposed to update.  This is
done if the target file's last-modification time has changed since
<code>make</code> first checked it.

   <p>The purpose of deleting the target is to make sure that it is remade from
scratch when <code>make</code> is next run.  Why is this?  Suppose you type
<kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd> while a compiler is running, and it has begun to write an
object file <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp>.  The <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd> kills the compiler, resulting
in an incomplete file whose last-modification time is newer than the source
file <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp>.  But <code>make</code> also receives the <kbd>Ctrl-c</kbd> signal
and deletes this incomplete file.  If <code>make</code> did not do this, the next
invocation of <code>make</code> would think that <samp><span class="file">foo.o</span></samp> did not require
updating&mdash;resulting in a strange error message from the linker when it
tries to link an object file half of which is missing.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_002ePRECIOUS-374"></a>You can prevent the deletion of a target file in this way by making the
special target <code>.PRECIOUS</code> depend on it.  Before remaking a target,
<code>make</code> checks to see whether it appears on the prerequisites of
<code>.PRECIOUS</code>, and thereby decides whether the target should be deleted
if a signal happens.  Some reasons why you might do this are that the
target is updated in some atomic fashion, or exists only to record a
modification-time (its contents do not matter), or must exist at all
times to prevent other sorts of trouble.
