This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

This is Edition 0.70, last updated 1 April 2006,
of `The GNU Make Manual', for GNU `make' version 3.81.

<h3 class="section">4.3 Types of Prerequisites</h3>

<p><a name="index-prerequisite-types-150"></a><a name="index-types-of-prerequisites-151"></a>
<a name="index-prerequisites_002c-normal-152"></a><a name="index-normal-prerequisites-153"></a><a name="index-prerequisites_002c-order_002donly-154"></a><a name="index-order_002donly-prerequisites-155"></a>There are actually two different types of prerequisites understood by
GNU <code>make</code>: normal prerequisites such as described in the
previous section, and <dfn>order-only</dfn> prerequisites.  A normal
prerequisite makes two statements: first, it imposes an order of
execution of build commands: any commands necessary to build any of a
target's prerequisites will be fully executed before any commands
necessary to build the target.  Second, it imposes a dependency
relationship: if any prerequisite is newer than the target, then the
target is considered out-of-date and must be rebuilt.

   <p>Normally, this is exactly what you want: if a target's prerequisite is
updated, then the target should also be updated.

   <p>Occasionally, however, you have a situation where you want to impose a
specific ordering on the rules to be invoked <em>without</em> forcing
the target to be updated if one of those rules is executed.  In that
case, you want to define <dfn>order-only</dfn> prerequisites.  Order-only
prerequisites can be specified by placing a pipe symbol (<code>|</code>)
in the prerequisites list: any prerequisites to the left of the pipe
symbol are normal; any prerequisites to the right are order-only:

<pre class="example">     <var>targets</var> : <var>normal-prerequisites</var> | <var>order-only-prerequisites</var>
</pre>
   <p>The normal prerequisites section may of course be empty.  Also, you
may still declare multiple lines of prerequisites for the same target:
they are appended appropriately.  Note that if you declare the same
file to be both a normal and an order-only prerequisite, the normal
prerequisite takes precedence (since they are a strict superset of the
behavior of an order-only prerequisite).
