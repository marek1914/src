automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

<h4 class="subsection">4.5.1 <code>VPATH</code>: Search Path for All Prerequisites</h4>

<p><a name="index-VPATH-182"></a>
The value of the <code>make</code> variable <code>VPATH</code> specifies a list of
directories that <code>make</code> should search.  Most often, the
directories are expected to contain prerequisite files that are not in the
current directory; however, <code>make</code> uses <code>VPATH</code> as a search
list for both prerequisites and targets of rules.

   <p>Thus, if a file that is listed as a target or prerequisite does not exist
in the current directory, <code>make</code> searches the directories listed in
<code>VPATH</code> for a file with that name.  If a file is found in one of
them, that file may become the prerequisite (see below).  Rules may then
specify the names of files in the prerequisite list as if they all
existed in the current directory.  See <a href="Commands_002fSearch.html#Commands_002fSearch">Writing Shell Commands with Directory Search</a>.

   <p>In the <code>VPATH</code> variable, directory names are separated by colons or
blanks.  The order in which directories are listed is the order followed
by <code>make</code> in its search.  (On MS-DOS and MS-Windows, semi-colons
are used as separators of directory names in <code>VPATH</code>, since the
colon can be used in the pathname itself, after the drive letter.)

   <p>For example,

<pre class="example">     VPATH = src:../headers
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">specifies a path containing two directories, <samp><span class="file">src</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">../headers</span></samp>, which <code>make</code> searches in that order.

   <p>With this value of <code>VPATH</code>, the following rule,

<pre class="example">     foo.o : foo.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is interpreted as if it were written like this:

<pre class="example">     foo.o : src/foo.c
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">assuming the file <samp><span class="file">foo.c</span></samp> does not exist in the current directory but
is found in the directory <samp><span class="file">src</span></samp>.
