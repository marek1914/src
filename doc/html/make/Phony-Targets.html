<h3 class="section">4.6 Phony Targets</h3>

<p><a name="index-phony-targets-212"></a><a name="index-targets_002c-phony-213"></a><a name="index-targets-without-a-file-214"></a>
A phony target is one that is not really the name of a file.  It is just a
name for some commands to be executed when you make an explicit request. 
There are two reasons to use a phony target: to avoid a conflict with
a file of the same name, and to improve performance.

   <p>If you write a rule whose commands will not create the target file, the
commands will be executed every time the target comes up for remaking. 
Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     clean:
             rm *.o temp
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Because the <code>rm</code> command does not create a file named <samp><span class="file">clean</span></samp>,
probably no such file will ever exist.  Therefore, the <code>rm</code> command
will be executed every time you say `<samp><span class="samp">make clean</span></samp>'. 
<a name="index-g_t_0040code_007brm_007d-_0028shell-command_0029-215"></a>
<a name="index-g_t_002ePHONY-216"></a>The phony target will cease to work if anything ever does create a file
named <samp><span class="file">clean</span></samp> in this directory.  Since it has no prerequisites, the
file <samp><span class="file">clean</span></samp> would inevitably be considered up to date, and its
commands would not be executed.  To avoid this problem, you can explicitly
declare the target to be phony, using the special target <code>.PHONY</code>
(see <a href="Special-Targets.html#Special-Targets">Special Built-in Target Names</a>) as follows:

<pre class="example">     .PHONY : clean
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Once this is done, `<samp><span class="samp">make clean</span></samp>' will run the commands regardless of
whether there is a file named <samp><span class="file">clean</span></samp>.

   <p>Since it knows that phony targets do not name actual files that could be
remade from other files, <code>make</code> skips the implicit rule search for
phony targets (see <a href="Implicit-Rules.html#Implicit-Rules">Implicit Rules</a>).  This is why declaring a target
phony is good for performance, even if you are not worried about the
actual file existing.

   <p>Thus, you first write the line that states that <code>clean</code> is a
phony target, then you write the rule, like this:

<pre class="example">     .PHONY: clean
     clean:
             rm *.o temp
</pre>
   <p>Another example of the usefulness of phony targets is in conjunction
with recursive invocations of <code>make</code> (for more information, see
<a href="Recursion.html#Recursion">Recursive Use of <code>make</code></a>).  In this case the
makefile will often contain a variable which lists a number of
subdirectories to be built.  One way to handle this is with one rule
whose command is a shell loop over the subdirectories, like this:

<pre class="example">     SUBDIRS = foo bar baz
     
     subdirs:
             for dir in $(SUBDIRS); do \
               $(MAKE) -C $$dir; \
             done
</pre>
   <p>There are a few problems with this method, however.  First, any error
detected in a submake is not noted by this rule, so it will continue to
build the rest of the directories even when one fails.  This can be
overcome by adding shell commands to note the error and exit, but then
it will do so even if <code>make</code> is invoked with the <code>-k</code> option,
which is unfortunate.  Second, and perhaps more importantly, you cannot
take advantage of <code>make</code>'s ability to build targets in parallel
(see <a href="Parallel.html#Parallel">Parallel Execution</a>), since there is only one rule.

   <p>By declaring the subdirectories as phony targets (you must do this as
the subdirectory obviously always exists; otherwise it won't be built)
you can remove these problems:

<pre class="example">     SUBDIRS = foo bar baz
     
     .PHONY: subdirs $(SUBDIRS)
     
     subdirs: $(SUBDIRS)
     
     $(SUBDIRS):
             $(MAKE) -C $@
     
     foo: baz
</pre>
   <p>Here we've also declared that the <samp><span class="file">foo</span></samp> subdirectory cannot be
built until after the <samp><span class="file">baz</span></samp> subdirectory is complete; this kind of
relationship declaration is particularly important when attempting
parallel builds.

   <p>A phony target should not be a prerequisite of a real target file; if it
is, its commands are run every time <code>make</code> goes to update that
file.  As long as a phony target is never a prerequisite of a real
target, the phony target commands will be executed only when the phony
target is a specified goal (see <a href="Goals.html#Goals">Arguments to Specify the Goals</a>).

   <p>Phony targets can have prerequisites.  When one directory contains multiple
programs, it is most convenient to describe all of the programs in one
makefile <samp><span class="file">./Makefile</span></samp>.  Since the target remade by default will be the
first one in the makefile, it is common to make this a phony target named
`<samp><span class="samp">all</span></samp>' and give it, as prerequisites, all the individual programs.  For
example:

<pre class="example">     all : prog1 prog2 prog3
     .PHONY : all
     
     prog1 : prog1.o utils.o
             cc -o prog1 prog1.o utils.o
     
     prog2 : prog2.o
             cc -o prog2 prog2.o
     
     prog3 : prog3.o sort.o utils.o
             cc -o prog3 prog3.o sort.o utils.o
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Now you can say just `<samp><span class="samp">make</span></samp>' to remake all three programs, or
specify as arguments the ones to remake (as in `<samp><span class="samp">make prog1
prog3</span></samp>').  Phoniness is not inherited: the prerequisites of a phony
target are not themselves phony, unless explicitly declared to be so.

   <p>When one phony target is a prerequisite of another, it serves as a subroutine
of the other.  For example, here `<samp><span class="samp">make cleanall</span></samp>' will delete the
object files, the difference files, and the file <samp><span class="file">program</span></samp>:

<pre class="example">     .PHONY: cleanall cleanobj cleandiff
     
     cleanall : cleanobj cleandiff
             rm program
     
     cleanobj :
             rm *.o
     
     cleandiff :
             rm *.diff
</pre>
   </body></html>
