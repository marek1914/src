This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

This is Edition 0.70, last updated 1 April 2006,
of `The GNU Make Manual', for GNU `make' version 3.81.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Command Syntax</h3>

<p><a name="index-command-syntax-294"></a><a name="index-syntax-of-commands-295"></a>
Makefiles have the unusual property that there are really two distinct
syntaxes in one file.  Most of the makefile uses <code>make</code> syntax
(see <a href="Makefiles.html#Makefiles">Writing Makefiles</a>).  However, commands are meant to be
interpreted by the shell and so they are written using shell syntax. 
The <code>make</code> program does not try to understand shell syntax: it
performs only a very few specific translations on the content of the
command before handing it to the shell.

   <p>Each command line must start with a tab, except that the first command
line may be attached to the target-and-prerequisites line with a
semicolon in between.  <em>Any</em> line in the makefile that begins
with a tab and appears in a &ldquo;rule context&rdquo; (that is, after a rule
has been started until another rule or variable definition) will be
considered a command line for that rule.  Blank lines and lines of
just comments may appear among the command lines; they are ignored.

   <p>Some consequences of these rules include:

     <ul>
<li>A blank line that begins with a tab is not blank: it's an empty
command (see <a href="Empty-Commands.html#Empty-Commands">Empty Commands</a>).

     <p><a name="index-comments_002c-in-commands-296"></a><a name="index-commands_002c-comments-in-297"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0023_007d-_0028comments_0029_002c-in-commands-298"></a><li>A comment in a command line is not a <code>make</code> comment; it will be
passed to the shell as-is.  Whether the shell treats it as a comment
or not depends on your shell.

     <li>A variable definition in a &ldquo;rule context&rdquo; which is indented by a tab
as the first character on the line, will be considered a command line,
not a <code>make</code> variable definition, and passed to the shell.

     <li>A conditional expression (<code>ifdef</code>, <code>ifeq</code>,
etc. see <a href="Conditional-Syntax.html#Conditional-Syntax">Syntax of Conditionals</a>) in a &ldquo;rule
context&rdquo; which is indented by a tab as the first character on the
line, will be considered a command line and be passed to the shell.
