This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

This is Edition 0.70, last updated 1 April 2006,
of `The GNU Make Manual', for GNU `make' version 3.81.

<h3 class="section">9.3 Instead of Executing the Commands</h3>

<p><a name="index-execution_002c-instead-of-663"></a><a name="index-commands_002c-instead-of-executing-664"></a>
The makefile tells <code>make</code> how to tell whether a target is up to date,
and how to update each target.  But updating the targets is not always
what you want.  Certain options specify other activities for <code>make</code>.

<!-- Extra blank lines make it print better. -->
<dl>
<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--just-print</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--dry-run</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--recon</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002djust_002dprint_007d-665"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002ddry_002drun_007d-666"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002drecon_007d-667"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002dn_007d-668"></a>
&ldquo;No-op&rdquo;.  The activity is to print what commands would be used to make
the targets up to date, but not actually execute them.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--touch</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dtouch_007d-669"></a><a name="index-touching-files-670"></a><a name="index-target_002c-touching-671"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002dt_007d-672"></a>
&ldquo;Touch&rdquo;.  The activity is to mark the targets as up to date without
actually changing them.  In other words, <code>make</code> pretends to compile
the targets but does not really change their contents.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--question</span></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dquestion_007d-673"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002dq_007d-674"></a><a name="index-question-mode-675"></a>
&ldquo;Question&rdquo;.  The activity is to find out silently whether the targets
are up to date already; but execute no commands in either case.  In other
words, neither compilation nor output will occur.

     <br><dt>`<samp><span class="samp">-W </span><var>file</var></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--what-if=</span><var>file</var></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--assume-new=</span><var>file</var></samp>'<dt>`<samp><span class="samp">--new-file=</span><var>file</var></samp>'<dd><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dwhat_002dif_007d-676"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002dW_007d-677"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dassume_002dnew_007d-678"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_002d_002dnew_002dfile_007d-679"></a><a name="index-what-if-680"></a><a name="index-files_002c-assuming-new-681"></a>
&ldquo;What if&rdquo;.  Each `<samp><span class="samp">-W</span></samp>' flag is followed by a file name.  The given
files' modification times are recorded by <code>make</code> as being the present
time, although the actual modification times remain the same. 
You can use the `<samp><span class="samp">-W</span></samp>' flag in conjunction with the `<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>' flag
to see what would happen if you were to modify specific files. 
</dl>

   <p>With the `<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>' flag, <code>make</code> prints the commands that it would
normally execute but does not execute them.

   <p>With the `<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>' flag, <code>make</code> ignores the commands in the rules
and uses (in effect) the command <code>touch</code> for each target that needs to
be remade.  The <code>touch</code> command is also printed, unless `<samp><span class="samp">-s</span></samp>' or
<code>.SILENT</code> is used.  For speed, <code>make</code> does not actually invoke
the program <code>touch</code>.  It does the work directly.

   <p>With the `<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>' flag, <code>make</code> prints nothing and executes no
commands, but the exit status code it returns is zero if and only if the
targets to be considered are already up to date.  If the exit status is
one, then some updating needs to be done.  If <code>make</code> encounters an
error, the exit status is two, so you can distinguish an error from a
target that is not up to date.

   <p>It is an error to use more than one of these three flags in the same
invocation of <code>make</code>.

   <p><a name="index-g_t_002b_002c-and-command-execution-682"></a>The `<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>', `<samp><span class="samp">-t</span></samp>', and `<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>' options do not affect command
lines that begin with `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>' characters or contain the strings
`<samp><span class="samp">$(MAKE)</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">${MAKE}</span></samp>'.  Note that only the line containing
the `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>' character or the strings `<samp><span class="samp">$(MAKE)</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">${MAKE}</span></samp>'
is run regardless of these options.  Other lines in the same rule are
not run unless they too begin with `<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>' or contain `<samp><span class="samp">$(MAKE)</span></samp>' or
`<samp><span class="samp">${MAKE}</span></samp>' (See <a href="MAKE-Variable.html#MAKE-Variable">How the <code>MAKE</code> Variable Works</a>.)

   <p>The `<samp><span class="samp">-W</span></samp>' flag provides two features:

     <ul>
<li>If you also use the `<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>' flag, you can see what
<code>make</code> would do if you were to modify some files.

     <li>Without the `<samp><span class="samp">-n</span></samp>' or `<samp><span class="samp">-q</span></samp>' flag, when <code>make</code> is actually
executing commands, the `<samp><span class="samp">-W</span></samp>' flag can direct <code>make</code> to act
as if some files had been modified, without actually modifying the
files. 
</ul>

   <p>Note that the options `<samp><span class="samp">-p</span></samp>' and `<samp><span class="samp">-v</span></samp>' allow you to obtain other
information about <code>make</code> or about the makefiles in use
(see <a href="Options-Summary.html#Options-Summary">Summary of Options</a>).
