This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

of `The GNU Make Manual', for GNU `make' version 3.81.

One of the few ways in which <code>make</code> does interpret command lines
is checking for a backslash just before the newline.  As in normal
makefile syntax, a single command can be split into multiple lines in
the makefile by placing a backslash before each newline.  A sequence
of lines like this is considered a single command, and one instance of
the shell will be invoked to run it.

   <p>However, in contrast to how they are treated in other places in a
makefile, backslash-newline pairs are <em>not</em> removed from the
command.  Both the backslash and the newline characters are preserved
and passed to the shell.  How the backslash-newline is interpreted
depends on your shell.  If the first character of the next line
after the backslash-newline is a tab, then that tab (and only that
tab) is removed.  Whitespace is never added to the command.

   <p>For example, this makefile:

<pre class="example">     all :
             @echo no\
     space
             @echo no\
             space
             @echo one \
             space
             @echo one\
              space
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">consists of four separate shell commands where the output is:

<pre class="example">     nospace
     nospace
     one space
     one space
</pre>
   <p>As a more complex example, this makefile:

<pre class="example">     all : ; @echo 'hello \
             world' ; echo "hello \
         world"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">will run one shell with a command script of:

<pre class="example">     echo 'hello \
     world' ; echo "hello \
         world"
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which, according to shell quoting rules, will yield the following output:

<pre class="example">     hello \
     world
     hello     world
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">Notice how the backslash/newline pair was removed inside the string quoted
with double quotes (<code>"..."</code>), but not from the string quoted with single
quotes (<code>'...'</code>).  This is the way the default shell (<samp><span class="file">/bin/sh</span></samp>)
handles backslash/newline pairs.  If you specify a different shell in your
makefiles it may treat them differently.

   <p>Sometimes you want to split a long line inside of single quotes, but
you don't want the backslash-newline to appear in the quoted content. 
This is often the case when passing scripts to languages such as Perl,
where extraneous backslashes inside the script can change its meaning
or even be a syntax error.  One simple way of handling this is to
place the quoted string, or even the entire command, into a
<code>make</code> variable then use the variable in the command.  In this
situation the newline quoting rules for makefiles will be used, and
the backslash-newline will be removed.  If we rewrite our example
above using this method:

<pre class="example">     HELLO = 'hello \
     world'
     
     all : ; @echo $(HELLO)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">we will get output like this:

<pre class="example">     hello world
</pre>
   <p>If you like, you can also use target-specific variables
(see <a href="Target_002dspecific.html#Target_002dspecific">Target-specific Variable Values</a>) to obtain
a tighter correspondence between the variable and the command that
uses it.
