This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

This is Edition 0.70, last updated 1 April 2006,
of `The GNU Make Manual', for GNU `make' version 3.81.

<h3 class="section">4.2 Rule Syntax</h3>

<p><a name="index-rule-syntax-139"></a><a name="index-syntax-of-rules-140"></a>In general, a rule looks like this:

<pre class="example">     <var>targets</var> : <var>prerequisites</var>
             <var>command</var>
             ...
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">or like this:

<pre class="example">     <var>targets</var> : <var>prerequisites</var> ; <var>command</var>
             <var>command</var>
             ...
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-targets-141"></a><a name="index-rule-targets-142"></a>The <var>targets</var> are file names, separated by spaces.  Wildcard
characters may be used (see <a href="Wildcards.html#Wildcards">Using Wildcard Characters in File Names</a>) and a name of the form <samp><var>a</var><span class="file">(</span><var>m</var><span class="file">)</span></samp>
represents member <var>m</var> in archive file <var>a</var>
(see <a href="Archive-Members.html#Archive-Members">Archive Members as Targets</a>). 
Usually there is only one
target per rule, but occasionally there is a reason to have more
(see <a href="Multiple-Targets.html#Multiple-Targets">Multiple Targets in a Rule</a>).

   <p><a name="index-commands-143"></a><a name="index-tab-character-_0028in-commands_0029-144"></a>The <var>command</var> lines start with a tab character.  The first command may
appear on the line after the prerequisites, with a tab character, or may
appear on the same line, with a semicolon.  Either way, the effect is the
same.  There are other differences in the syntax of command lines. 
See <a href="Commands.html#Commands">Writing the Commands in Rules</a>.

   <p><a name="index-dollar-sign-_0028_0040code_007b_0024_007d_0029_002c-in-rules-145"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040code_007b_0024_007d_002c-in-rules-146"></a><a name="index-rules_002c-and-_0040code_007b_0024_007d-147"></a>Because dollar signs are used to start <code>make</code> variable
references, if you really want a dollar sign in a target or
prerequisite you must write two of them, `<samp><span class="samp">$$</span></samp>' (see <a href="Using-Variables.html#Using-Variables">How to Use Variables</a>).  If you have enabled secondary
expansion (see <a href="Secondary-Expansion.html#Secondary-Expansion">Secondary Expansion</a>) and you want a literal dollar
sign in the prerequisites lise, you must actually write <em>four</em>
dollar signs (`<samp><span class="samp">$$$$</span></samp>').

   <p>You may split a long line by inserting a backslash followed by a
newline, but this is not required, as <code>make</code> places no limit on
the length of a line in a makefile.

   <p>A rule tells <code>make</code> two things: when the targets are out of date,
and how to update them when necessary.

   <p><a name="index-prerequisites-148"></a><a name="index-rule-prerequisites-149"></a>The criterion for being out of date is specified in terms of the
<var>prerequisites</var>, which consist of file names separated by spaces. 
(Wildcards and archive members (see <a href="Archives.html#Archives">Archives</a>) are allowed here too.) 
A target is out of date if it does not exist or if it is older than any
of the prerequisites (by comparison of last-modification times).  The
idea is that the contents of the target file are computed based on
information in the prerequisites, so if any of the prerequisites changes,
the contents of the existing target file are no longer necessarily
valid.

   <p>How to update is specified by <var>commands</var>.  These are lines to be
executed by the shell (normally `<samp><span class="samp">sh</span></samp>'), but with some extra features
(see <a href="Commands.html#Commands">Writing the Commands in Rules</a>).
