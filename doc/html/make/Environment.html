This file documents the GNU `make' utility, which determines
automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled,
and issues the commands to recompile them.

This is Edition 0.70, last updated 1 April 2006,
of `The GNU Make Manual', for GNU `make' version 3.81.

<h3 class="section">6.9 Variables from the Environment</h3>

<p><a name="index-variables_002c-environment-519"></a><a name="index-environment-520"></a>Variables in <code>make</code> can come from the environment in which
<code>make</code> is run.  Every environment variable that <code>make</code> sees
when it starts up is transformed into a <code>make</code> variable with the
same name and value.  However, an explicit assignment in the makefile,
or with a command argument, overrides the environment.  (If the
`<samp><span class="samp">-e</span></samp>' flag is specified, then values from the environment override
assignments in the makefile.  See <a href="Options-Summary.html#Options-Summary">Summary of Options</a>.  But this is not recommended practice.)

   <p>Thus, by setting the variable <code>CFLAGS</code> in your environment, you can
cause all C compilations in most makefiles to use the compiler switches you
prefer.  This is safe for variables with standard or conventional meanings
because you know that no makefile will use them for other things.  (Note
this is not totally reliable; some makefiles set <code>CFLAGS</code> explicitly
and therefore are not affected by the value in the environment.)

   <p>When <code>make</code> runs a command script, variables defined in the
makefile are placed into the environment of that command.  This allows
you to pass values to sub-<code>make</code> invocations (see <a href="Recursion.html#Recursion">Recursive Use of <code>make</code></a>).  By default, only variables that came
from the environment or the command line are passed to recursive
invocations.  You can use the <code>export</code> directive to pass other
variables.  See <a href="Variables_002fRecursion.html#Variables_002fRecursion">Communicating Variables to a Sub-<code>make</code></a>, for full details.

   <p>Other use of variables from the environment is not recommended.  It is not
wise for makefiles to depend for their functioning on environment variables
set up outside their control, since this would cause different users to get
different results from the same makefile.  This is against the whole
purpose of most makefiles.

   <p><a name="index-SHELL_002c-import-from-environment-521"></a>Such problems would be especially likely with the variable
<code>SHELL</code>, which is normally present in the environment to specify
the user's choice of interactive shell.  It would be very undesirable
for this choice to affect <code>make</code>; so, <code>make</code> handles the
<code>SHELL</code> environment variable in a special way; see <a href="Choosing-the-Shell.html#Choosing-the-Shell">Choosing the Shell</a>.
