<h3 class="section">3.8 Shell Scripts</h3>

<p><a name="index-shell-script-106"></a>
A shell script is a text file containing shell commands.  When such
a file is used as the first non-option argument when invoking Bash,
and neither the <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp> nor <samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp> option is supplied
(see <a href="Invoking-Bash.html#Invoking-Bash">Invoking Bash</a>),
Bash reads and executes commands from the file, then exits.  This
mode of operation creates a non-interactive shell.  The shell first
searches for the file in the current directory, and looks in the
directories in <samp><span class="env">$PATH</span></samp> if not found there.

   <p>When Bash runs
a shell script, it sets the special parameter <code>0</code> to the name
of the file, rather than the name of the shell, and the positional
parameters are set to the remaining arguments, if any are given. 
If no additional arguments are supplied, the positional parameters
are unset.

   <p>A shell script may be made executable by using the <code>chmod</code> command
to turn on the execute bit.  When Bash finds such a file while
searching the <samp><span class="env">$PATH</span></samp> for a command, it spawns a subshell to
execute it.  In other words, executing
<pre class="example">     filename <var>arguments</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">is equivalent to executing
<pre class="example">     bash filename <var>arguments</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">if <code>filename</code> is an executable shell script. 
This subshell reinitializes itself, so that the effect is as if a
new shell had been invoked to interpret the script, with the
exception that the locations of commands remembered by the parent
(see the description of <code>hash</code> in <a href="Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html#Bourne-Shell-Builtins">Bourne Shell Builtins</a>)
are retained by the child.

   <p>Most versions of Unix make this a part of the operating system's command
execution mechanism.  If the first line of a script begins with
the two characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#!</span></samp>&rsquo;, the remainder of the line specifies
an interpreter for the program. 
Thus, you can specify Bash, <code>awk</code>, Perl, or some other
interpreter and write the rest of the script file in that language.

   <p>The arguments to the interpreter
consist of a single optional argument following the interpreter
name on the first line of the script file, followed by the name of
the script file, followed by the rest of the arguments.  Bash
will perform this action on operating systems that do not handle it
themselves.  Note that some older versions of Unix limit the interpreter
name and argument to a maximum of 32 characters.

   <p>Bash scripts often begin with <code>#! /bin/bash</code> (assuming that
Bash has been installed in <samp><span class="file">/bin</span></samp>), since this ensures that
Bash will be used to interpret the script, even if it is executed
under another shell.
