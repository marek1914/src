<h4 class="subsection">4.3.1 The Set Builtin</h4>

<p>This builtin is so complicated that it deserves its own section.  <code>set</code>
allows you to change the values of shell options and set the positional
parameters, or to display the names and values of shell variables.

     <dl>
<dt><code>set</code><dd><a name="index-set-149"></a>
     <pre class="example">          set [--abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT] [-o <var>option</var>] [<var>argument</var> ...]
          set [+abefhkmnptuvxBCEHPT] [+o <var>option</var>] [<var>argument</var> ...]
</pre>
     <p>If no options or arguments are supplied, <code>set</code> displays the names
and values of all shell variables and functions, sorted according to the
current locale, in a format that may be reused as input
for setting or resetting the currently-set variables. 
Read-only variables cannot be reset. 
In <span class="sc">posix</span> mode, only shell variables are listed.

     <p>When options are supplied, they set or unset shell attributes. 
Options, if specified, have the following meanings:

          <dl>
<dt><code>-a</code><dd>Mark variables and function which are modified or created for export
to the environment of subsequent commands.

          <br><dt><code>-b</code><dd>Cause the status of terminated background jobs to be reported
immediately, rather than before printing the next primary prompt.

          <br><dt><code>-e</code><dd>Exit immediately if a pipeline (see <a href="Pipelines.html#Pipelines">Pipelines</a>), which may consist
of a single simple command (see <a href="Simple-Commands.html#Simple-Commands">Simple Commands</a>),
a subshell command enclosed in parentheses (see <a href="Command-Grouping.html#Command-Grouping">Command Grouping</a>),
or one of the commands executed as part of a command list enclosed
by braces (see <a href="Command-Grouping.html#Command-Grouping">Command Grouping</a>)
returns a non-zero status. 
The shell does not exit if the command that fails is part of the
command list immediately following a <code>while</code> or <code>until</code> keyword,
part of the test in an <code>if</code> statement,
part of any command executed in a <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code> list except
the command following the final <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code>,
any command in a pipeline but the last,
or if the command's return status is being inverted with <code>!</code>. 
A trap on <code>ERR</code>, if set, is executed before the shell exits.

          <p>This option applies to the shell environment and each subshell environment
separately (see <a href="Command-Execution-Environment.html#Command-Execution-Environment">Command Execution Environment</a>), and may cause
subshells to exit before executing all the commands in the subshell.

          <br><dt><code>-f</code><dd>Disable filename expansion (globbing).

          <br><dt><code>-h</code><dd>Locate and remember (hash) commands as they are looked up for execution. 
This option is enabled by default.

          <br><dt><code>-k</code><dd>All arguments in the form of assignment statements are placed
in the environment for a command, not just those that precede
the command name.

          <br><dt><code>-m</code><dd>Job control is enabled (see <a href="Job-Control.html#Job-Control">Job Control</a>).

          <br><dt><code>-n</code><dd>Read commands but do not execute them; this may be used to check a
script for syntax errors. 
This option is ignored by interactive shells.

          <br><dt><code>-o </code><var>option-name</var><dd>
Set the option corresponding to <var>option-name</var>:

               <dl>
<dt><code>allexport</code><dd>Same as <code>-a</code>.

               <br><dt><code>braceexpand</code><dd>Same as <code>-B</code>.

               <br><dt><code>emacs</code><dd>Use an <code>emacs</code>-style line editing interface (see <a href="Command-Line-Editing.html#Command-Line-Editing">Command Line Editing</a>). 
This also affects the editing interface used for <code>read -e</code>.

               <br><dt><code>errexit</code><dd>Same as <code>-e</code>.

               <br><dt><code>errtrace</code><dd>Same as <code>-E</code>.

               <br><dt><code>functrace</code><dd>Same as <code>-T</code>.

               <br><dt><code>hashall</code><dd>Same as <code>-h</code>.

               <br><dt><code>histexpand</code><dd>Same as <code>-H</code>.

               <br><dt><code>history</code><dd>Enable command history, as described in <a href="Bash-History-Facilities.html#Bash-History-Facilities">Bash History Facilities</a>. 
This option is on by default in interactive shells.

               <br><dt><code>ignoreeof</code><dd>An interactive shell will not exit upon reading EOF.

               <br><dt><code>keyword</code><dd>Same as <code>-k</code>.

               <br><dt><code>monitor</code><dd>Same as <code>-m</code>.

               <br><dt><code>noclobber</code><dd>Same as <code>-C</code>.

               <br><dt><code>noexec</code><dd>Same as <code>-n</code>.

               <br><dt><code>noglob</code><dd>Same as <code>-f</code>.

               <br><dt><code>nolog</code><dd>Currently ignored.

               <br><dt><code>notify</code><dd>Same as <code>-b</code>.

               <br><dt><code>nounset</code><dd>Same as <code>-u</code>.

               <br><dt><code>onecmd</code><dd>Same as <code>-t</code>.

               <br><dt><code>physical</code><dd>Same as <code>-P</code>.

               <br><dt><code>pipefail</code><dd>If set, the return value of a pipeline is the value of the last
(rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all
commands in the pipeline exit successfully. 
This option is disabled by default.

               <br><dt><code>posix</code><dd>Change the behavior of Bash where the default operation differs
from the <span class="sc">posix</span> standard to match the standard
(see <a href="Bash-POSIX-Mode.html#Bash-POSIX-Mode">Bash POSIX Mode</a>). 
This is intended to make Bash behave as a strict superset of that
standard.

               <br><dt><code>privileged</code><dd>Same as <code>-p</code>.

               <br><dt><code>verbose</code><dd>Same as <code>-v</code>.

               <br><dt><code>vi</code><dd>Use a <code>vi</code>-style line editing interface. 
This also affects the editing interface used for <code>read -e</code>.

               <br><dt><code>xtrace</code><dd>Same as <code>-x</code>. 
</dl>

          <br><dt><code>-p</code><dd>Turn on privileged mode. 
In this mode, the <samp><span class="env">$BASH_ENV</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">$ENV</span></samp> files are not
processed, shell functions are not inherited from the environment,
and the <samp><span class="env">SHELLOPTS</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">BASHOPTS</span></samp>, <samp><span class="env">CDPATH</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">GLOBIGNORE</span></samp>
variables, if they appear in the environment, are ignored. 
If the shell is started with the effective user (group) id not equal to the
real user (group) id, and the <code>-p</code> option is not supplied, these actions
are taken and the effective user id is set to the real user id. 
If the <code>-p</code> option is supplied at startup, the effective user id is
not reset. 
Turning this option off causes the effective user
and group ids to be set to the real user and group ids.

          <br><dt><code>-t</code><dd>Exit after reading and executing one command.

          <br><dt><code>-u</code><dd>Treat unset variables and parameters other than the special parameters
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; as an error when performing parameter expansion. 
An error message will be written to the standard error, and a non-interactive
shell will exit.

          <br><dt><code>-v</code><dd>Print shell input lines as they are read.

          <br><dt><code>-x</code><dd>Print a trace of simple commands, <code>for</code> commands, <code>case</code>
commands, <code>select</code> commands, and arithmetic <code>for</code> commands
and their arguments or associated word lists after they are
expanded and before they are executed.  The value of the <samp><span class="env">PS4</span></samp>
variable is expanded and the resultant value is printed before
the command and its expanded arguments.

          <br><dt><code>-B</code><dd>The shell will perform brace expansion (see <a href="Brace-Expansion.html#Brace-Expansion">Brace Expansion</a>). 
This option is on by default.

          <br><dt><code>-C</code><dd>Prevent output redirection using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&lt;&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;
from overwriting existing files.

          <br><dt><code>-E</code><dd>If set, any trap on <code>ERR</code> is inherited by shell functions, command
substitutions, and commands executed in a subshell environment. 
The <code>ERR</code> trap is normally not inherited in such cases.

          <br><dt><code>-H</code><dd>Enable &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; style history substitution (see <a href="History-Interaction.html#History-Interaction">History Interaction</a>). 
This option is on by default for interactive shells.

          <br><dt><code>-P</code><dd>If set, do not follow symbolic links when performing commands such as
<code>cd</code> which change the current directory.  The physical directory
is used instead.  By default, Bash follows
the logical chain of directories when performing commands
which change the current directory.

          <p>For example, if <samp><span class="file">/usr/sys</span></samp> is a symbolic link to <samp><span class="file">/usr/local/sys</span></samp>
then:
          <pre class="example">               $ cd /usr/sys; echo $PWD
               /usr/sys
               $ cd ..; pwd
               /usr
</pre>
          <p class="noindent">If <code>set -P</code> is on, then:
          <pre class="example">               $ cd /usr/sys; echo $PWD
               /usr/local/sys
               $ cd ..; pwd
               /usr/local
</pre>
          <br><dt><code>-T</code><dd>If set, any trap on <code>DEBUG</code> and <code>RETURN</code> are inherited by
shell functions, command substitutions, and commands executed
in a subshell environment. 
The <code>DEBUG</code> and <code>RETURN</code> traps are normally not inherited
in such cases.

          <br><dt><code>--</code><dd>If no arguments follow this option, then the positional parameters are
unset.  Otherwise, the positional parameters are set to the
<var>arguments</var>, even if some of them begin with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>-</code><dd>Signal the end of options, cause all remaining <var>arguments</var>
to be assigned to the positional parameters.  The <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp>
and <samp><span class="option">-v</span></samp>  options are turned off. 
If there are no arguments, the positional parameters remain unchanged. 
</dl>

     <p>Using &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; rather than &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; causes these options to be
turned off.  The options can also be used upon invocation of the
shell.  The current set of options may be found in <code>$-</code>.

     <p>The remaining N <var>arguments</var> are positional parameters and are
assigned, in order, to <code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, <small class="dots">...</small>  <code>$N</code>. 
The special parameter <code>#</code> is set to N.

     <p>The return status is always zero unless an invalid option is supplied. 
</dl>
