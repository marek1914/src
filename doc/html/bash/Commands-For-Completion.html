     <dl>
<dt><code>complete (&lt;TAB&gt;)</code><a name="index-complete-_0028_0040key_007bTAB_007d_0029-358"></a><dd>Attempt to perform completion on the text before point. 
The actual completion performed is application-specific. 
Bash attempts completion treating the text as a variable (if the
text begins with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;), username (if the text begins with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo;), hostname (if the text begins with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;), or
command (including aliases and functions) in turn.  If none
of these produces a match, filename completion is attempted.

     <br><dt><code>possible-completions (M-?)</code><a name="index-possible_002dcompletions-_0028M_002d_003f_0029-359"></a><dd>List the possible completions of the text before point.

     <br><dt><code>insert-completions (M-*)</code><a name="index-insert_002dcompletions-_0028M_002d_002a_0029-360"></a><dd>Insert all completions of the text before point that would have
been generated by <code>possible-completions</code>.

     <br><dt><code>menu-complete ()</code><a name="index-menu_002dcomplete-_0028_0029-361"></a><dd>Similar to <code>complete</code>, but replaces the word to be completed
with a single match from the list of possible completions. 
Repeated execution of <code>menu-complete</code> steps through the list
of possible completions, inserting each match in turn. 
At the end of the list of completions, the bell is rung
(subject to the setting of <code>bell-style</code>)
and the original text is restored. 
An argument of <var>n</var> moves <var>n</var> positions forward in the list
of matches; a negative argument may be used to move backward
through the list. 
This command is intended to be bound to &lt;TAB&gt;, but is unbound
by default.

     <br><dt><code>menu-complete-backward ()</code><a name="index-menu_002dcomplete_002dbackward-_0028_0029-362"></a><dd>Identical to <code>menu-complete</code>, but moves backward through the list
of possible completions, as if <code>menu-complete</code> had been given a
negative argument.

     <br><dt><code>delete-char-or-list ()</code><a name="index-delete_002dchar_002dor_002dlist-_0028_0029-363"></a><dd>Deletes the character under the cursor if not at the beginning or
end of the line (like <code>delete-char</code>). 
If at the end of the line, behaves identically to
<code>possible-completions</code>. 
This command is unbound by default.

     <br><dt><code>complete-filename (M-/)</code><dd>Attempt filename completion on the text before point.

     <br><dt><code>possible-filename-completions (C-x /)</code><dd>List the possible completions of the text before point,
treating it as a filename.

     <br><dt><code>complete-username (M-~)</code><dd>Attempt completion on the text before point, treating
it as a username.

     <br><dt><code>possible-username-completions (C-x ~)</code><dd>List the possible completions of the text before point,
treating it as a username.

     <br><dt><code>complete-variable (M-$)</code><dd>Attempt completion on the text before point, treating
it as a shell variable.

     <br><dt><code>possible-variable-completions (C-x $)</code><dd>List the possible completions of the text before point,
treating it as a shell variable.

     <br><dt><code>complete-hostname (M-@)</code><dd>Attempt completion on the text before point, treating
it as a hostname.

     <br><dt><code>possible-hostname-completions (C-x @)</code><dd>List the possible completions of the text before point,
treating it as a hostname.

     <br><dt><code>complete-command (M-!)</code><dd>Attempt completion on the text before point, treating
it as a command name.  Command completion attempts to
match the text against aliases, reserved words, shell
functions, shell builtins, and finally executable filenames,
in that order.

     <br><dt><code>possible-command-completions (C-x !)</code><dd>List the possible completions of the text before point,
treating it as a command name.

     <br><dt><code>dynamic-complete-history (M-&lt;TAB&gt;)</code><dd>Attempt completion on the text before point, comparing
the text against lines from the history list for possible
completion matches.

     <br><dt><code>dabbrev-expand ()</code><dd>Attempt menu completion on the text before point, comparing
the text against lines from the history list for possible
completion matches.

     <br><dt><code>complete-into-braces (M-{)</code><dd>Perform filename completion and insert the list of possible completions
enclosed within braces so the list is available to the shell
(see <a href="Brace-Expansion.html#Brace-Expansion">Brace Expansion</a>).
