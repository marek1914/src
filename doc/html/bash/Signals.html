<h4 class="subsection">3.7.6 Signals</h4>

<p><a name="index-signal-handling-105"></a>
When Bash is interactive, in the absence of any traps, it ignores
<code>SIGTERM</code> (so that &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">kill 0</span></samp>&rsquo; does not kill an interactive shell),
and <code>SIGINT</code>
is caught and handled (so that the <code>wait</code> builtin is interruptible). 
When Bash receives a <code>SIGINT</code>, it breaks out of any executing loops. 
In all cases, Bash ignores <code>SIGQUIT</code>. 
If job control is in effect (see <a href="Job-Control.html#Job-Control">Job Control</a>), Bash
ignores <code>SIGTTIN</code>, <code>SIGTTOU</code>, and <code>SIGTSTP</code>.

   <p>Non-builtin commands started by Bash have signal handlers set to the
values inherited by the shell from its parent. 
When job control is not in effect, asynchronous commands
ignore <code>SIGINT</code> and <code>SIGQUIT</code> in addition to these inherited
handlers. 
Commands run as a result of
command substitution ignore the keyboard-generated job control signals
<code>SIGTTIN</code>, <code>SIGTTOU</code>, and <code>SIGTSTP</code>.

   <p>The shell exits by default upon receipt of a <code>SIGHUP</code>. 
Before exiting, an interactive shell resends the <code>SIGHUP</code> to
all jobs, running or stopped. 
Stopped jobs are sent <code>SIGCONT</code> to ensure that they receive
the <code>SIGHUP</code>. 
To prevent the shell from sending the <code>SIGHUP</code> signal to a
particular job, it should be removed
from the jobs table with the <code>disown</code>
builtin (see <a href="Job-Control-Builtins.html#Job-Control-Builtins">Job Control Builtins</a>) or marked
to not receive <code>SIGHUP</code> using <code>disown -h</code>.

   <p>If the  <code>huponexit</code> shell option has been set with <code>shopt</code>
(see <a href="The-Shopt-Builtin.html#The-Shopt-Builtin">The Shopt Builtin</a>), Bash sends a <code>SIGHUP</code> to all jobs when
an interactive login shell exits.

   <p>If Bash is waiting for a command to complete and receives a signal
for which a trap has been set, the trap will not be executed until
the command completes. 
When Bash is waiting for an asynchronous
command via the <code>wait</code> builtin, the reception of a signal for
which a trap has been set will cause the <code>wait</code> builtin to return
immediately with an exit status greater than 128, immediately after
which the trap is executed.
