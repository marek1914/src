<p><a name="index-command-history-388"></a><a name="index-history-list-389"></a>
When the <samp><span class="option">-o history</span></samp> option to the <code>set</code> builtin
is enabled (see <a href="The-Set-Builtin.html#The-Set-Builtin">The Set Builtin</a>),
the shell provides access to the <dfn>command history</dfn>,
the list of commands previously typed. 
The value of the <samp><span class="env">HISTSIZE</span></samp> shell variable is used as the
number of commands to save in a history list. 
The text of the last <samp><span class="env">$HISTSIZE</span></samp>
commands (default 500) is saved. 
The shell stores each command in the history list prior to
parameter and variable expansion
but after history expansion is performed, subject to the
values of the shell variables
<samp><span class="env">HISTIGNORE</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">HISTCONTROL</span></samp>.

   <p>When the shell starts up, the history is initialized from the
file named by the <samp><span class="env">HISTFILE</span></samp> variable (default <samp><span class="file">~/.bash_history</span></samp>). 
The file named by the value of <samp><span class="env">HISTFILE</span></samp> is truncated, if
necessary, to contain no more than the number of lines specified by
the value of the <samp><span class="env">HISTFILESIZE</span></samp> variable. 
When an interactive shell exits, the last
<samp><span class="env">$HISTSIZE</span></samp> lines are copied from the history list to the file
named by <samp><span class="env">$HISTFILE</span></samp>. 
If the <code>histappend</code> shell option is set (see <a href="Bash-Builtins.html#Bash-Builtins">Bash Builtins</a>),
the lines are appended to the history file,
otherwise the history file is overwritten. 
If <samp><span class="env">HISTFILE</span></samp>
is unset, or if the history file is unwritable, the history is
not saved.  After saving the history, the history file is truncated
to contain no more than <samp><span class="env">$HISTFILESIZE</span></samp>
lines.  If <samp><span class="env">HISTFILESIZE</span></samp> is not set, no truncation is performed.

   <p>If the <samp><span class="env">HISTTIMEFORMAT</span></samp> is set, the time stamp information
associated with each history entry is written to the history file,
marked with the history comment character. 
When the history file is read, lines beginning with the history
comment character followed immediately by a digit are interpreted
as timestamps for the previous history line.

   <p>The builtin command <code>fc</code> may be used to list or edit and re-execute
a portion of the history list. 
The <code>history</code> builtin may be used to display or modify the history
list and manipulate the history file. 
When using command-line editing, search commands
are available in each editing mode that provide access to the
history list (see <a href="Commands-For-History.html#Commands-For-History">Commands For History</a>).

   <p>The shell allows control over which commands are saved on the history
list.  The <samp><span class="env">HISTCONTROL</span></samp> and <samp><span class="env">HISTIGNORE</span></samp>
variables may be set to cause the shell to save only a subset of the
commands entered. 
The <code>cmdhist</code>
shell option, if enabled, causes the shell to attempt to save each
line of a multi-line command in the same history entry, adding
semicolons where necessary to preserve syntactic correctness. 
The <code>lithist</code>
shell option causes the shell to save the command with embedded newlines
instead of semicolons. 
The <code>shopt</code> builtin is used to set these options. 
See <a href="Bash-Builtins.html#Bash-Builtins">Bash Builtins</a>, for a description of <code>shopt</code>.
