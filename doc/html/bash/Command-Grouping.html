<h5 class="subsubsection">3.2.4.3 Grouping Commands</h5>

<p><a name="index-commands_002c-grouping-59"></a>
Bash provides two ways to group a list of commands to be executed
as a unit.  When commands are grouped, redirections may be applied
to the entire command list.  For example, the output of all the
commands in the list may be redirected to a single stream.

     <dl>
<dt><code>()</code><dd>
     <pre class="example">          ( <var>list</var> )
</pre>
     <p>Placing a list of commands between parentheses causes a subshell
environment to be created (see <a href="Command-Execution-Environment.html#Command-Execution-Environment">Command Execution Environment</a>), and each
of the commands in <var>list</var> to be executed in that subshell.  Since the
<var>list</var> is executed in a subshell, variable assignments do not remain in
effect after the subshell completes.

     <br><dt><code>{}</code><dd><a name="index-g_t_0040_007b-60"></a><a name="index-g_t_0040_007d-61"></a>
     <pre class="example">          { <var>list</var>; }
</pre>
     <p>Placing a list of commands between curly braces causes the list to
be executed in the current shell context.  No subshell is created. 
The semicolon (or newline) following <var>list</var> is required. 
</dl>

   <p>In addition to the creation of a subshell, there is a subtle difference
between these two constructs due to historical reasons.  The braces
are <code>reserved words</code>, so they must be separated from the <var>list</var>
by <code>blank</code>s or other shell metacharacters. 
The parentheses are <code>operators</code>, and are
recognized as separate tokens by the shell even if they are not separated
from the <var>list</var> by whitespace.

   <p>The exit status of both of these constructs is the exit status of
<var>list</var>.
