<h4 class="subsection">3.5.1 Brace Expansion</h4>

<p><a name="index-brace-expansion-81"></a><a name="index-expansion_002c-brace-82"></a>
Brace expansion is a mechanism by which arbitrary strings may be generated. 
This mechanism is similar to
<var>filename expansion</var> (see <a href="Filename-Expansion.html#Filename-Expansion">Filename Expansion</a>),
but the file names generated need not exist. 
Patterns to be brace expanded take the form of an optional <var>preamble</var>,
followed by either a series of comma-separated strings or a seqeunce expression
between a pair of braces,
followed by an optional <var>postscript</var>. 
The preamble is prefixed to each string contained within the braces, and
the postscript is then appended to each resulting string, expanding left
to right.

   <p>Brace expansions may be nested. 
The results of each expanded string are not sorted; left to right order
is preserved. 
For example,
<pre class="example">     bash$ echo a{d,c,b}e
     ade ace abe
</pre>
   <p>A sequence expression takes the form <code>{</code><var>x</var><code>..</code><var>y</var><code>[..</code><var>incr</var><code>]}</code>,
where <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> are either integers or single characters,
and <var>incr</var>, an optional increment, is an integer. 
When integers are supplied, the expression expands to each number between
<var>x</var> and <var>y</var>, inclusive. 
Supplied integers may be prefixed with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo; to force each term to have the
same width.  When either <var>x</var> or <var>y</var> begins with a zero, the shell
attempts to force all generated terms to contain the same number of digits,
zero-padding where necessary. 
When characters are supplied, the expression expands to each character
lexicographically between <var>x</var> and <var>y</var>, inclusive.  Note that
both <var>x</var> and <var>y</var> must be of the same type. 
When the increment is supplied, it is used as the difference between
each term.  The default increment is 1 or -1 as appropriate.

   <p>Brace expansion is performed before any other expansions,
and any characters special to other expansions are preserved
in the result.  It is strictly textual.  Bash
does not apply any syntactic interpretation to the context of the
expansion or the text between the braces. 
To avoid conflicts with parameter expansion, the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">${</span></samp>&rsquo;
is not considered eligible for brace expansion.

   <p>A correctly-formed brace expansion must contain unquoted opening
and closing braces, and at least one unquoted comma or a valid
sequence expression. 
Any incorrectly formed brace expansion is left unchanged.

   <p>A { or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">,</span></samp>&rsquo; may be quoted with a backslash to prevent its
being considered part of a brace expression. 
To avoid conflicts with parameter expansion, the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">${</span></samp>&rsquo;
is not considered eligible for brace expansion.

   <p>This construct is typically used as shorthand when the common
prefix of the strings to be generated is longer than in the
above example:
<pre class="example">     mkdir /usr/local/src/bash/{old,new,dist,bugs}
</pre>
   <p>or
<pre class="example">     chown root /usr/{ucb/{ex,edit},lib/{ex?.?*,how_ex}}
</pre>
   </body></html>
