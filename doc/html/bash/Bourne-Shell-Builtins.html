<h3 class="section">4.1 Bourne Shell Builtins</h3>

<p>The following shell builtin commands are inherited from the Bourne Shell. 
These commands are implemented as specified by the <span class="sc">posix</span> standard.

     <dl>
<dt><code>:    </code><span class="roman">(a colon)</span><dd><a name="index-g_t_003a-107"></a>
     <pre class="example">          : [<var>arguments</var>]
</pre>
     <p>Do nothing beyond expanding <var>arguments</var> and performing redirections. 
The return status is zero.

     <br><dt><code>.    </code><span class="roman">(a period)</span><dd><a name="index-g_t_002e-108"></a>
     <pre class="example">          . <var>filename</var> [<var>arguments</var>]
</pre>
     <p>Read and execute commands from the <var>filename</var> argument in the
current shell context.  If <var>filename</var> does not contain a slash,
the <samp><span class="env">PATH</span></samp> variable is used to find <var>filename</var>. 
When Bash is not in <span class="sc">posix</span> mode, the current directory is searched
if <var>filename</var> is not found in <samp><span class="env">$PATH</span></samp>. 
If any <var>arguments</var> are supplied, they become the positional
parameters when <var>filename</var> is executed.  Otherwise the positional
parameters are unchanged. 
The return status is the exit status of the last command executed, or
zero if no commands are executed.  If <var>filename</var> is not found, or
cannot be read, the return status is non-zero. 
This builtin is equivalent to <code>source</code>.

     <br><dt><code>break</code><dd><a name="index-break-109"></a>
     <pre class="example">          break [<var>n</var>]
</pre>
     <p>Exit from a <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>until</code>, or <code>select</code> loop. 
If <var>n</var> is supplied, the <var>n</var>th enclosing loop is exited. 
<var>n</var> must be greater than or equal to 1. 
The return status is zero unless <var>n</var> is not greater than or equal to 1.

     <br><dt><code>cd</code><dd><a name="index-cd-110"></a>
     <pre class="example">          cd [-L|-P] [<var>directory</var>]
</pre>
     <p>Change the current working directory to <var>directory</var>. 
If <var>directory</var> is not given, the value of the <samp><span class="env">HOME</span></samp> shell
variable is used. 
If the shell variable <samp><span class="env">CDPATH</span></samp> exists, it is used as a search path. 
If <var>directory</var> begins with a slash, <samp><span class="env">CDPATH</span></samp> is not used.

     <p>The <samp><span class="option">-P</span></samp> option means to not follow symbolic links; symbolic
links are followed by default or with the <samp><span class="option">-L</span></samp> option. 
If <var>directory</var> is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, it is equivalent to <samp><span class="env">$OLDPWD</span></samp>.

     <p>If a non-empty directory name from <samp><span class="env">CDPATH</span></samp> is used, or if
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo; is the first argument, and the directory change is
successful, the absolute pathname of the new working directory is
written to the standard output.

     <p>The return status is zero if the directory is successfully changed,
non-zero otherwise.

     <br><dt><code>continue</code><dd><a name="index-continue-111"></a>
     <pre class="example">          continue [<var>n</var>]
</pre>
     <p>Resume the next iteration of an enclosing <code>for</code>, <code>while</code>,
<code>until</code>, or <code>select</code> loop. 
If <var>n</var> is supplied, the execution of the <var>n</var>th enclosing loop
is resumed. 
<var>n</var> must be greater than or equal to 1. 
The return status is zero unless <var>n</var> is not greater than or equal to 1.

     <br><dt><code>eval</code><dd><a name="index-eval-112"></a>
     <pre class="example">          eval [<var>arguments</var>]
</pre>
     <p>The arguments are concatenated together into a single command, which is
then read and executed, and its exit status returned as the exit status
of <code>eval</code>. 
If there are no arguments or only empty arguments, the return status is
zero.

     <br><dt><code>exec</code><dd><a name="index-exec-113"></a>
     <pre class="example">          exec [-cl] [-a <var>name</var>] [<var>command</var> [<var>arguments</var>]]
</pre>
     <p>If <var>command</var>
is supplied, it replaces the shell without creating a new process. 
If the <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> option is supplied, the shell places a dash at the
beginning of the zeroth argument passed to <var>command</var>. 
This is what the <code>login</code> program does. 
The <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp> option causes <var>command</var> to be executed with an empty
environment. 
If <samp><span class="option">-a</span></samp> is supplied, the shell passes <var>name</var> as the zeroth
argument to <var>command</var>. 
If no <var>command</var> is specified, redirections may be used to affect
the current shell environment.  If there are no redirection errors, the
return status is zero; otherwise the return status is non-zero.

     <br><dt><code>exit</code><dd><a name="index-exit-114"></a>
     <pre class="example">          exit [<var>n</var>]
</pre>
     <p>Exit the shell, returning a status of <var>n</var> to the shell's parent. 
If <var>n</var> is omitted, the exit status is that of the last command executed. 
Any trap on <code>EXIT</code> is executed before the shell terminates.

     <br><dt><code>export</code><dd><a name="index-export-115"></a>
     <pre class="example">          export [-fn] [-p] [<var>name</var>[=<var>value</var>]]
</pre>
     <p>Mark each <var>name</var> to be passed to child processes
in the environment.  If the <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp> option is supplied, the <var>name</var>s
refer to shell functions; otherwise the names refer to shell variables. 
The <samp><span class="option">-n</span></samp> option means to no longer mark each <var>name</var> for export. 
If no <var>names</var> are supplied, or if the <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> option is given, a
list of exported names is displayed. 
The <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> option displays output in a form that may be reused as input. 
If a variable name is followed by =<var>value</var>, the value of
the variable is set to <var>value</var>.

     <p>The return status is zero unless an invalid option is supplied, one of
the names is not a valid shell variable name, or <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp> is supplied
with a name that is not a shell function.

     <br><dt><code>getopts</code><dd><a name="index-getopts-116"></a>
     <pre class="example">          getopts <var>optstring</var> <var>name</var> [<var>args</var>]
</pre>
     <p><code>getopts</code> is used by shell scripts to parse positional parameters. 
<var>optstring</var> contains the option characters to be recognized; if a
character is followed by a colon, the option is expected to have an
argument, which should be separated from it by white space. 
The colon (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;) and question mark (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;) may not be
used as option characters. 
Each time it is invoked, <code>getopts</code>
places the next option in the shell variable <var>name</var>, initializing
<var>name</var> if it does not exist,
and the index of the next argument to be processed into the
variable <samp><span class="env">OPTIND</span></samp>. 
<samp><span class="env">OPTIND</span></samp> is initialized to 1 each time the shell or a shell script
is invoked. 
When an option requires an argument,
<code>getopts</code> places that argument into the variable <samp><span class="env">OPTARG</span></samp>. 
The shell does not reset <samp><span class="env">OPTIND</span></samp> automatically; it must be manually
reset between multiple calls to <code>getopts</code> within the same shell
invocation if a new set of parameters is to be used.

     <p>When the end of options is encountered, <code>getopts</code> exits with a
return value greater than zero. 
<samp><span class="env">OPTIND</span></samp> is set to the index of the first non-option argument,
and <code>name</code> is set to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <p><code>getopts</code>
normally parses the positional parameters, but if more arguments are
given in <var>args</var>, <code>getopts</code> parses those instead.

     <p><code>getopts</code> can report errors in two ways.  If the first character of
<var>optstring</var> is a colon, <var>silent</var>
error reporting is used.  In normal operation diagnostic messages
are printed when invalid options or missing option arguments are
encountered. 
If the variable <samp><span class="env">OPTERR</span></samp>
is set to 0, no error messages will be displayed, even if the first
character of <code>optstring</code> is not a colon.

     <p>If an invalid option is seen,
<code>getopts</code> places &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo; into <var>name</var> and, if not silent,
prints an error message and unsets <samp><span class="env">OPTARG</span></samp>. 
If <code>getopts</code> is silent, the option character found is placed in
<samp><span class="env">OPTARG</span></samp> and no diagnostic message is printed.

     <p>If a required argument is not found, and <code>getopts</code>
is not silent, a question mark (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;) is placed in <var>name</var>,
<code>OPTARG</code> is unset, and a diagnostic message is printed. 
If <code>getopts</code> is silent, then a colon (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo;) is placed in
<var>name</var> and <samp><span class="env">OPTARG</span></samp> is set to the option character found.

     <br><dt><code>hash</code><dd><a name="index-hash-117"></a>
     <pre class="example">          hash [-r] [-p <var>filename</var>] [-dt] [<var>name</var>]
</pre>
     <p>Remember the full pathnames of commands specified as <var>name</var> arguments,
so they need not be searched for on subsequent invocations. 
The commands are found by searching through the directories listed in
<samp><span class="env">$PATH</span></samp>. 
The <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> option inhibits the path search, and <var>filename</var> is
used as the location of <var>name</var>. 
The <samp><span class="option">-r</span></samp> option causes the shell to forget all remembered locations. 
The <samp><span class="option">-d</span></samp> option causes the shell to forget the remembered location
of each <var>name</var>. 
If the <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp> option is supplied, the full pathname to which each
<var>name</var> corresponds is printed.  If multiple <var>name</var> arguments are
supplied with <samp><span class="option">-t</span></samp> the <var>name</var> is printed before the hashed
full pathname. 
The <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> option causes output to be displayed in a format
that may be reused as input. 
If no arguments are given, or if only <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> is supplied,
information about remembered commands is printed. 
The return status is zero unless a <var>name</var> is not found or an invalid
option is supplied.

     <br><dt><code>pwd</code><dd><a name="index-pwd-118"></a>
     <pre class="example">          pwd [-LP]
</pre>
     <p>Print the absolute pathname of the current working directory. 
If the <samp><span class="option">-P</span></samp> option is supplied, the pathname printed will not
contain symbolic links. 
If the <samp><span class="option">-L</span></samp> option is supplied, the pathname printed may contain
symbolic links. 
The return status is zero unless an error is encountered while
determining the name of the current directory or an invalid option
is supplied.

     <br><dt><code>readonly</code><dd><a name="index-readonly-119"></a>
     <pre class="example">          readonly [-aApf] [<var>name</var>[=<var>value</var>]] ...
</pre>
     <p>Mark each <var>name</var> as readonly. 
The values of these names may not be changed by subsequent assignment. 
If the <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp> option is supplied, each <var>name</var> refers to a shell
function. 
The <samp><span class="option">-a</span></samp> option means each <var>name</var> refers to an indexed
array variable; the <samp><span class="option">-A</span></samp> option means each <var>name</var> refers
to an associative array variable. 
If no <var>name</var> arguments are given, or if the <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp>
option is supplied, a list of all readonly names is printed. 
The <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> option causes output to be displayed in a format that
may be reused as input. 
If a variable name is followed by =<var>value</var>, the value of
the variable is set to <var>value</var>. 
The return status is zero unless an invalid option is supplied, one of
the <var>name</var> arguments is not a valid shell variable or function name,
or the <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp> option is supplied with a name that is not a shell function.

     <br><dt><code>return</code><dd><a name="index-return-120"></a>
     <pre class="example">          return [<var>n</var>]
</pre>
     <p>Cause a shell function to exit with the return value <var>n</var>. 
If <var>n</var> is not supplied, the return value is the exit status of the
last command executed in the function. 
This may also be used to terminate execution of a script being executed
with the <code>.</code> (or <code>source</code>) builtin, returning either <var>n</var> or
the exit status of the last command executed within the script as the exit
status of the script. 
Any command associated with the <code>RETURN</code> trap is executed
before execution resumes after the function or script. 
The return status is non-zero if <code>return</code> is used outside a function
and not during the execution of a script by <code>.</code> or <code>source</code>.

     <br><dt><code>shift</code><dd><a name="index-shift-121"></a>
     <pre class="example">          shift [<var>n</var>]
</pre>
     <p>Shift the positional parameters to the left by <var>n</var>. 
The positional parameters from <var>n</var>+1 <small class="dots">...</small> <code>$#</code> are
renamed to <code>$1</code> <small class="dots">...</small> <code>$#</code>-<var>n</var>. 
Parameters represented by the numbers <code>$#</code> to <code>$#</code>-<var>n</var>+1
are unset. 
<var>n</var> must be a non-negative number less than or equal to <code>$#</code>. 
If <var>n</var> is zero or greater than <code>$#</code>, the positional parameters
are not changed. 
If <var>n</var> is not supplied, it is assumed to be 1. 
The return status is zero unless <var>n</var> is greater than <code>$#</code> or
less than zero, non-zero otherwise.

     <br><dt><code>test</code><dt><code>[</code><dd><a name="index-test-122"></a><a name="index-g_t_005b-123"></a>Evaluate a conditional expression <var>expr</var>. 
Each operator and operand must be a separate argument. 
Expressions are composed of the primaries described below in
<a href="Bash-Conditional-Expressions.html#Bash-Conditional-Expressions">Bash Conditional Expressions</a>. 
<code>test</code> does not accept any options, nor does it accept and ignore
an argument of <samp><span class="option">--</span></samp> as signifying the end of options.

     <p>When the <code>[</code> form is used, the last argument to the command must
be a <code>]</code>.

     <p>Expressions may be combined using the following operators, listed in
decreasing order of precedence. 
The evaluation depends on the number of arguments; see below.

          <dl>
<dt><code>! </code><var>expr</var><dd>True if <var>expr</var> is false.

          <br><dt><code>( </code><var>expr</var><code> )</code><dd>Returns the value of <var>expr</var>. 
This may be used to override the normal precedence of operators.

          <br><dt><var>expr1</var><code> -a </code><var>expr2</var><dd>True if both <var>expr1</var> and <var>expr2</var> are true.

          <br><dt><var>expr1</var><code> -o </code><var>expr2</var><dd>True if either <var>expr1</var> or <var>expr2</var> is true. 
</dl>

     <p>The <code>test</code> and <code>[</code> builtins evaluate conditional
expressions using a set of rules based on the number of arguments.

          <dl>
<dt>0 arguments<dd>The expression is false.

          <br><dt>1 argument<dd>The expression is true if and only if the argument is not null.

          <br><dt>2 arguments<dd>If the first argument is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;, the expression is true if and
only if the second argument is null. 
If the first argument is one of the unary conditional operators
(see <a href="Bash-Conditional-Expressions.html#Bash-Conditional-Expressions">Bash Conditional Expressions</a>), the expression
is true if the unary test is true. 
If the first argument is not a valid unary operator, the expression is
false.

          <br><dt>3 arguments<dd>If the second argument is one of the binary conditional
operators (see <a href="Bash-Conditional-Expressions.html#Bash-Conditional-Expressions">Bash Conditional Expressions</a>), the
result of the expression is the result of the binary test using the
first and third arguments as operands. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-a</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-o</span></samp>&rsquo; operators are considered binary operators
when there are three arguments. 
If the first argument is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;, the value is the negation of
the two-argument test using the second and third arguments. 
If the first argument is exactly &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">(</span></samp>&rsquo; and the third argument is
exactly &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">)</span></samp>&rsquo;, the result is the one-argument test of the second
argument. 
Otherwise, the expression is false.

          <br><dt>4 arguments<dd>If the first argument is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;, the result is the negation of
the three-argument expression composed of the remaining arguments. 
Otherwise, the expression is parsed and evaluated according to
precedence using the rules listed above.

          <br><dt>5 or more arguments<dd>The expression is parsed and evaluated according to precedence
using the rules listed above. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><code>times</code><dd><a name="index-times-124"></a>
     <pre class="example">          times
</pre>
     <p>Print out the user and system times used by the shell and its children. 
The return status is zero.

     <br><dt><code>trap</code><dd><a name="index-trap-125"></a>
     <pre class="example">          trap [-lp] [<var>arg</var>] [<var>sigspec</var> ...]
</pre>
     <p>The commands in <var>arg</var> are to be read and executed when the
shell receives signal <var>sigspec</var>.  If <var>arg</var> is absent (and
there is a single <var>sigspec</var>) or
equal to &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;, each specified signal's disposition is reset
to the value it had when the shell was started. 
If <var>arg</var> is the null string, then the signal specified by
each <var>sigspec</var> is ignored by the shell and commands it invokes. 
If <var>arg</var> is not present and <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> has been supplied,
the shell displays the trap commands associated with each <var>sigspec</var>. 
If no arguments are supplied, or
only <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> is given, <code>trap</code> prints the list of commands
associated with each signal number in a form that may be reused as
shell input. 
The <samp><span class="option">-l</span></samp> option causes the shell to print a list of signal names
and their corresponding numbers. 
Each <var>sigspec</var> is either a signal name or a signal number. 
Signal names are case insensitive and the <code>SIG</code> prefix is optional.

     <p>If a <var>sigspec</var>
is <code>0</code> or <code>EXIT</code>, <var>arg</var> is executed when the shell exits. 
If a <var>sigspec</var> is <code>DEBUG</code>, the command <var>arg</var> is executed
before every simple command, <code>for</code> command, <code>case</code> command,
<code>select</code> command, every arithmetic <code>for</code> command, and before
the first command executes in a shell function. 
Refer to the description of the <code>extdebug</code> option to the
<code>shopt</code> builtin (see <a href="The-Shopt-Builtin.html#The-Shopt-Builtin">The Shopt Builtin</a>) for details of its
effect on the <code>DEBUG</code> trap. 
If a <var>sigspec</var> is <code>RETURN</code>, the command <var>arg</var> is executed
each time a shell function or a script executed with the <code>.</code> or
<code>source</code> builtins finishes executing.

     <p>If a <var>sigspec</var> is <code>ERR</code>, the command <var>arg</var>
is executed whenever a simple command has a non-zero exit status,
subject to the following conditions. 
The <code>ERR</code> trap is not executed if the failed command is part of the
command list immediately following an <code>until</code> or <code>while</code> keyword,
part of the test following the <code>if</code> or <code>elif</code> reserved words,
part of a command executed in a <code>&amp;&amp;</code> or <code>||</code> list,
or if the command's return
status is being inverted using <code>!</code>. 
These are the same conditions obeyed by the <code>errexit</code> option.

     <p>Signals ignored upon entry to the shell cannot be trapped or reset. 
Trapped signals that are not being ignored are reset to their original
values in a subshell or subshell environment when one is created.

     <p>The return status is zero unless a <var>sigspec</var> does not specify a
valid signal.

     <br><dt><code>umask</code><dd><a name="index-umask-126"></a>
     <pre class="example">          umask [-p] [-S] [<var>mode</var>]
</pre>
     <p>Set the shell process's file creation mask to <var>mode</var>.  If
<var>mode</var> begins with a digit, it is interpreted as an octal number;
if not, it is interpreted as a symbolic mode mask similar
to that accepted by the <code>chmod</code> command.  If <var>mode</var> is
omitted, the current value of the mask is printed.  If the <samp><span class="option">-S</span></samp>
option is supplied without a <var>mode</var> argument, the mask is printed
in a symbolic format. 
If the  <samp><span class="option">-p</span></samp> option is supplied, and <var>mode</var>
is omitted, the output is in a form that may be reused as input. 
The return status is zero if the mode is successfully changed or if
no <var>mode</var> argument is supplied, and non-zero otherwise.

     <p>Note that when the mode is interpreted as an octal number, each number

     <p>Each variable or function <var>name</var> is removed. 
If no options are supplied, or the <samp><span class="option">-v</span></samp> option is given, each
<var>name</var> refers to a shell variable. 
If the <samp><span class="option">-f</span></samp> option is given, the <var>name</var>s refer to shell
functions, and the function definition is removed. 
Readonly variables and functions may not be unset. 
The return status is zero unless a <var>name</var> is readonly.
