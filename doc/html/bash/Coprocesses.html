<h4 class="subsection">3.2.5 Coprocesses</h4>

<p><a name="index-coprocess-62"></a>
A <code>coprocess</code> is a shell command preceded by the <code>coproc</code>
reserved word. 
A coprocess is executed asynchronously in a subshell, as if the command
had been terminated with the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; control operator, with a two-way pipe
established between the executing shell and the coprocess.

   <p>The format for a coprocess is:
<pre class="example">     <code>coproc</code> [<var>NAME</var>] <var>command</var> [<var>redirections</var>]
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">This creates a coprocess named <var>NAME</var>. 
If <var>NAME</var> is not supplied, the default name is <var>COPROC</var>. 
<var>NAME</var> must not be supplied if <var>command</var> is a simple
command (see <a href="Simple-Commands.html#Simple-Commands">Simple Commands</a>); otherwise, it is interpreted as
the first word of the simple command.

   <p>When the coproc is executed, the shell creates an array variable
(see <a href="Arrays.html#Arrays">Arrays</a>)
named <var>NAME</var> in the context of the executing shell. 
The standard output of <var>command</var>
is connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell,
and that file descriptor is assigned to <var>NAME</var>[0]. 
The standard input of <var>command</var>
is connected via a pipe to a file descriptor in the executing shell,
and that file descriptor is assigned to <var>NAME</var>[1]. 
This pipe is established before any redirections specified by the
command (see <a href="Redirections.html#Redirections">Redirections</a>). 
The file descriptors can be utilized as arguments to shell commands
and redirections using standard word expansions.

   <p>The process id of the shell spawned to execute the coprocess is
available as the value of the variable <var>NAME</var>_PID. 
The <code>wait</code>
builtin command may be used to wait for the coprocess to terminate.

   <p>The return status of a coprocess is the exit status of <var>command</var>.
