<h3 class="section">5.2 Bash Variables</h3>

<p>These variables are set or used by Bash, but other shells
do not normally treat them specially.

   <p>A few variables used by Bash are described in different chapters:
variables for controlling the job control facilities
(see <a href="Job-Control-Variables.html#Job-Control-Variables">Job Control Variables</a>).

     <dl>
<dt><code>BASH</code><a name="index-BASH-162"></a><dd>The full pathname used to execute the current instance of Bash.

     <br><dt><code>BASHOPTS</code><a name="index-BASHOPTS-163"></a><dd>A colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each word in
the list is a valid argument for the <samp><span class="option">-s</span></samp> option to the
<code>shopt</code> builtin command (see <a href="The-Shopt-Builtin.html#The-Shopt-Builtin">The Shopt Builtin</a>). 
The options appearing in <samp><span class="env">BASHOPTS</span></samp> are those reported
as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo; by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">shopt</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
If this variable is in the environment when Bash
starts up, each shell option in the list will be enabled before
reading any startup files.  This variable is readonly.

     <br><dt><code>BASHPID</code><a name="index-BASHPID-164"></a><dd>Expands to the process id of the current Bash process. 
This differs from <code>$$</code> under certain circumstances, such as subshells
that do not require Bash to be re-initialized.

     <br><dt><code>BASH_ALIASES</code><a name="index-BASH_005fALIASES-165"></a><dd>An associative array variable whose members correspond to the internal
list of aliases as maintained by the <code>alias</code> builtin
(see <a href="Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html#Bourne-Shell-Builtins">Bourne Shell Builtins</a>). 
Elements added to this array appear in the alias list; unsetting array
elements cause aliases to be removed from the alias list.

     <br><dt><code>BASH_ARGC</code><a name="index-BASH_005fARGC-166"></a><dd>An array variable whose values are the number of parameters in each
frame of the current bash execution call stack.  The number of
parameters to the current subroutine (shell function or script executed
with <code>.</code> or <code>source</code>) is at the top of the stack.  When a
subroutine is executed, the number of parameters passed is pushed onto
<code>BASH_ARGC</code>. 
The shell sets <code>BASH_ARGC</code> only when in extended debugging mode
(see <a href="The-Shopt-Builtin.html#The-Shopt-Builtin">The Shopt Builtin</a>
for a description of the <code>extdebug</code> option to the <code>shopt</code>
builtin).

     <br><dt><code>BASH_ARGV</code><a name="index-BASH_005fARGV-167"></a><dd>An array variable containing all of the parameters in the current bash
execution call stack.  The final parameter of the last subroutine call
is at the top of the stack; the first parameter of the initial call is
at the bottom.  When a subroutine is executed, the parameters supplied
are pushed onto <code>BASH_ARGV</code>. 
The shell sets <code>BASH_ARGV</code> only when in extended debugging mode
(see <a href="The-Shopt-Builtin.html#The-Shopt-Builtin">The Shopt Builtin</a>
for a description of the <code>extdebug</code> option to the <code>shopt</code>
builtin).

     <br><dt><code>BASH_CMDS</code><a name="index-BASH_005fCMDS-168"></a><dd>An associative array variable whose members correspond to the internal
hash table of commands as maintained by the <code>hash</code> builtin
(see <a href="Bourne-Shell-Builtins.html#Bourne-Shell-Builtins">Bourne Shell Builtins</a>). 
Elements added to this array appear in the hash table; unsetting array
elements cause commands to be removed from the hash table.

     <br><dt><code>BASH_COMMAND</code><a name="index-BASH_005fCOMMAND-169"></a><dd>The command currently being executed or about to be executed, unless the
shell is executing a command as the result of a trap,
in which case it is the command executing at the time of the trap.

     <br><dt><code>BASH_ENV</code><a name="index-BASH_005fENV-170"></a><dd>If this variable is set when Bash is invoked to execute a shell
script, its value is expanded and used as the name of a startup file
to read before executing the script.  See <a href="Bash-Startup-Files.html#Bash-Startup-Files">Bash Startup Files</a>.

     <br><dt><code>BASH_EXECUTION_STRING</code><a name="index-BASH_005fEXECUTION_005fSTRING-171"></a><dd>The command argument to the <samp><span class="option">-c</span></samp> invocation option.

     <br><dt><code>BASH_LINENO</code><a name="index-BASH_005fLINENO-172"></a><dd>An array variable whose members are the line numbers in source files
corresponding to each member of <var>FUNCNAME</var>. 
<code>${BASH_LINENO[$i]}</code> is the line number in the source file where
<code>${FUNCNAME[$i]}</code> was called (or <code>${BASH_LINENO[$i-1]}</code> if
referenced within another shell function). 
The corresponding source file name is <code>${BASH_SOURCE[$i]}</code>. 
Use <code>LINENO</code> to obtain the current line number.

     <br><dt><code>BASH_REMATCH</code><a name="index-BASH_005fREMATCH-173"></a><dd>An array variable whose members are assigned by the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">=~</span></samp>&rsquo; binary
operator to the <code>[[</code> conditional command
(see <a href="Conditional-Constructs.html#Conditional-Constructs">Conditional Constructs</a>). 
The element with index 0 is the portion of the string
matching the entire regular expression. 
The element with index <var>n</var> is the portion of the
string matching the <var>n</var>th parenthesized subexpression. 
This variable is read-only.

     <br><dt><code>BASH_SOURCE</code><a name="index-BASH_005fSOURCE-174"></a><dd>An array variable whose members are the source filenames corresponding
to the elements in the <code>FUNCNAME</code> array variable.

     <br><dt><code>BASH_SUBSHELL</code><a name="index-BASH_005fSUBSHELL-175"></a><dd>Incremented by one each time a subshell or subshell environment is spawned. 
The initial value is 0.

     <br><dt><code>BASH_VERSINFO</code><a name="index-BASH_005fVERSINFO-176"></a><dd>A readonly array variable (see <a href="Arrays.html#Arrays">Arrays</a>)
whose members hold version information for this instance of Bash. 
The values assigned to the array members are as follows:

          <dl>
<dt><code>BASH_VERSINFO[0]</code><dd>The major version number (the <var>release</var>).

          <br><dt><code>BASH_VERSINFO[1]</code><dd>The minor version number (the <var>version</var>).

          <br><dt><code>BASH_VERSINFO[2]</code><dd>The patch level.

          <br><dt><code>BASH_VERSINFO[3]</code><dd>The build version.

          <br><dt><code>BASH_VERSINFO[4]</code><dd>The release status (e.g., <var>beta1</var>).

          <br><dt><code>BASH_VERSINFO[5]</code><dd>The value of <samp><span class="env">MACHTYPE</span></samp>.

     </dl>

     <br><dt><code>BASH_VERSION</code><a name="index-BASH_005fVERSION-177"></a><dd>The version number of the current instance of Bash.

     <br><dt><code>BASH_XTRACEFD</code><a name="index-BASH_005fXTRACEFD-178"></a><dd>If set to an integer corresponding to a valid file descriptor, Bash
will write the trace output generated when &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set -x</span></samp>&rsquo;
is enabled to that file descriptor. 
This allows tracing output to be separated from diagnostic and error
messages. 
The file descriptor is closed when <code>BASH_XTRACEFD</code> is unset or assigned
a new value. 
Unsetting <code>BASH_XTRACEFD</code> or assigning it the empty string causes the
trace output to be sent to the standard error. 
Note that setting <code>BASH_XTRACEFD</code> to 2 (the standard error file
descriptor) and then unsetting it will result in the standard error
being closed.

     <br><dt><code>COLUMNS</code><a name="index-COLUMNS-179"></a><dd>Used by the <code>select</code> builtin command to determine the terminal width
when printing selection lists.  Automatically set upon receipt of a
<code>SIGWINCH</code>.

     <br><dt><code>COMP_CWORD</code><a name="index-COMP_005fCWORD-180"></a><dd>An index into <samp><span class="env">${COMP_WORDS}</span></samp> of the word containing the current
cursor position. 
This variable is available only in shell functions invoked by the
programmable completion facilities (see <a href="Programmable-Completion.html#Programmable-Completion">Programmable Completion</a>).

     <br><dt><code>COMP_LINE</code><a name="index-COMP_005fLINE-181"></a><dd>The current command line. 
This variable is available only in shell functions and external
commands invoked by the
programmable completion facilities (see <a href="Programmable-Completion.html#Programmable-Completion">Programmable Completion</a>).

     <br><dt><code>COMP_POINT</code><a name="index-COMP_005fPOINT-182"></a><dd>The index of the current cursor position relative to the beginning of
the current command. 
If the current cursor position is at the end of the current command,
the value of this variable is equal to <code>${#COMP_LINE}</code>. 
This variable is available only in shell functions and external
commands invoked by the
programmable completion facilities (see <a href="Programmable-Completion.html#Programmable-Completion">Programmable Completion</a>).

     <br><dt><code>COMP_TYPE</code><a name="index-COMP_005fTYPE-183"></a><dd>Set to an integer value corresponding to the type of completion attempted
that caused a completion function to be called:
<var>TAB</var>, for normal completion,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">?</span></samp>&rsquo;, for listing completions after successive tabs,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;, for listing alternatives on partial word completion,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">@</span></samp>&rsquo;, to list completions if the word is not unmodified,
or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;, for menu completion. 
This variable is available only in shell functions and external
commands invoked by the
programmable completion facilities (see <a href="Programmable-Completion.html#Programmable-Completion">Programmable Completion</a>).

     <br><dt><code>COMP_KEY</code><a name="index-COMP_005fKEY-184"></a><dd>The key (or final key of a key sequence) used to invoke the current
completion function.

     <br><dt><code>COMP_WORDBREAKS</code><a name="index-COMP_005fWORDBREAKS-185"></a><dd>The set of characters that the Readline library treats as word
separators when performing word completion. 
If <code>COMP_WORDBREAKS</code> is unset, it loses its special properties,
even if it is subsequently reset.

     <br><dt><code>COMP_WORDS</code><a name="index-COMP_005fWORDS-186"></a><dd>An array variable consisting of the individual
words in the current command line. 
The line is split into words as Readline would split it, using
<code>COMP_WORDBREAKS</code> as described above. 
This variable is available only in shell functions invoked by the
programmable completion facilities (see <a href="Programmable-Completion.html#Programmable-Completion">Programmable Completion</a>).

     <br><dt><code>COMPREPLY</code><a name="index-COMPREPLY-187"></a><dd>An array variable from which Bash reads the possible completions
generated by a shell function invoked by the programmable completion
facility (see <a href="Programmable-Completion.html#Programmable-Completion">Programmable Completion</a>).

     <br><dt><code>DIRSTACK</code><a name="index-DIRSTACK-188"></a><dd>An array variable containing the current contents of the directory stack. 
Directories appear in the stack in the order they are displayed by the
<code>dirs</code> builtin. 
Assigning to members of this array variable may be used to modify
directories already in the stack, but the <code>pushd</code> and <code>popd</code>
builtins must be used to add and remove directories. 
Assignment to this variable will not change the current directory. 
If <samp><span class="env">DIRSTACK</span></samp> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if
it is subsequently reset.

     <br><dt><code>EMACS</code><a name="index-EMACS-189"></a><dd>If Bash finds this variable in the environment when the shell
starts with value &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">t</span></samp>&rsquo;, it assumes that the shell is running in an
emacs shell buffer and disables line editing.

     <br><dt><code>EUID</code><a name="index-EUID-190"></a><dd>The numeric effective user id of the current user.  This variable
is readonly.

     <br><dt><code>FCEDIT</code><a name="index-FCEDIT-191"></a><dd>The editor used as a default by the <samp><span class="option">-e</span></samp> option to the <code>fc</code>
builtin command.

     <br><dt><code>FIGNORE</code><a name="index-FIGNORE-192"></a><dd>A colon-separated list of suffixes to ignore when performing
filename completion. 
A file name whose suffix matches one of the entries in
<samp><span class="env">FIGNORE</span></samp>
is excluded from the list of matched file names.  A sample
value is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.o:~</span></samp>&rsquo;

     <br><dt><code>FUNCNAME</code><a name="index-FUNCNAME-193"></a><dd>An array variable containing the names of all shell functions
currently in the execution call stack. 
The element with index 0 is the name of any currently-executing
shell function. 
The bottom-most element is <code>"main"</code>. 
This variable exists only when a shell function is executing. 
Assignments to <samp><span class="env">FUNCNAME</span></samp> have no effect and return an error status. 
If <samp><span class="env">FUNCNAME</span></samp> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if
it is subsequently reset.

     <br><dt><code>GLOBIGNORE</code><a name="index-GLOBIGNORE-194"></a><dd>A colon-separated list of patterns defining the set of filenames to
be ignored by filename expansion. 
If a filename matched by a filename expansion pattern also matches one
of the patterns in <samp><span class="env">GLOBIGNORE</span></samp>, it is removed from the list
of matches.

     <br><dt><code>GROUPS</code><a name="index-GROUPS-195"></a><dd>An array variable containing the list of groups of which the current
user is a member. 
Assignments to <samp><span class="env">GROUPS</span></samp> have no effect and return an error status. 
If <samp><span class="env">GROUPS</span></samp> is unset, it loses its special properties, even if it is
subsequently reset.

     <br><dt><code>histchars</code><a name="index-histchars-196"></a><dd>Up to three characters which control history expansion, quick
substitution, and tokenization (see <a href="History-Interaction.html#History-Interaction">History Interaction</a>). 
The first character is the
<var>history expansion</var> character, that is, the character which signifies the
start of a history expansion, normally &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The second character is the
character which signifies `quick substitution' when seen as the first
character on a line, normally &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The optional third character is the
character which indicates that the remainder of the line is a comment when
found as the first character of a word, usually &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo;.  The history
comment character causes history substitution to be skipped for the
remaining words on the line.  It does not necessarily cause the shell
parser to treat the rest of the line as a comment.

     <br><dt><code>HISTCMD</code><a name="index-HISTCMD-197"></a><dd>The history number, or index in the history list, of the current
command.  If <samp><span class="env">HISTCMD</span></samp> is unset, it loses its special properties,
even if it is subsequently reset.

     <br><dt><code>HISTCONTROL</code><a name="index-HISTCONTROL-198"></a><dd>A colon-separated list of values controlling how commands are saved on
the history list. 
If the list of values includes &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ignorespace</span></samp>&rsquo;, lines which begin
with a space character are not saved in the history list. 
A value of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ignoredups</span></samp>&rsquo; causes lines which match the previous
history entry to not be saved. 
A value of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ignoreboth</span></samp>&rsquo; is shorthand for
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ignorespace</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ignoredups</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
A value of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">erasedups</span></samp>&rsquo; causes all previous lines matching the
current line to be removed from the history list before that line
is saved. 
Any value not in the above list is ignored. 
If <samp><span class="env">HISTCONTROL</span></samp> is unset, or does not include a valid value,
all lines read by the shell parser are saved on the history list,
subject to the value of <samp><span class="env">HISTIGNORE</span></samp>. 
The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line compound command are
not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the value of
<samp><span class="env">HISTCONTROL</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>HISTFILE</code><a name="index-HISTFILE-199"></a><dd>The name of the file to which the command history is saved.  The
default value is <samp><span class="file">~/.bash_history</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>HISTFILESIZE</code><a name="index-HISTFILESIZE-200"></a><dd>The maximum number of lines contained in the history file.  When this
variable is assigned a value, the history file is truncated, if
necessary, by removing the oldest entries,
to contain no more than that number of lines. 
The history file is also truncated to this size after
writing it when an interactive shell exits. 
The default value is 500.

     <br><dt><code>HISTIGNORE</code><a name="index-HISTIGNORE-201"></a><dd>A colon-separated list of patterns used to decide which command
lines should be saved on the history list.  Each pattern is
anchored at the beginning of the line and must match the complete
line (no implicit &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; is appended).  Each pattern is tested
against the line after the checks specified by <samp><span class="env">HISTCONTROL</span></samp>
are applied.  In addition to the normal shell pattern matching
characters, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; matches the previous history line.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo;
may be escaped using a backslash; the backslash is removed
before attempting a match. 
The second and subsequent lines of a multi-line compound command are
not tested, and are added to the history regardless of the value of
<samp><span class="env">HISTIGNORE</span></samp>.

     <p><samp><span class="env">HISTIGNORE</span></samp> subsumes the function of <samp><span class="env">HISTCONTROL</span></samp>.  A
pattern of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&amp;</span></samp>&rsquo; is identical to <code>ignoredups</code>, and a
pattern of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[ ]*</span></samp>&rsquo; is identical to <code>ignorespace</code>. 
Combining these two patterns, separating them with a colon,
provides the functionality of <code>ignoreboth</code>.

     <br><dt><code>HISTSIZE</code><a name="index-HISTSIZE-202"></a><dd>The maximum number of commands to remember on the history list. 
The default value is 500.

     <br><dt><code>HISTTIMEFORMAT</code><a name="index-HISTTIMEFORMAT-203"></a><dd>If this variable is set and not null, its value is used as a format string
for <var>strftime</var> to print the time stamp associated with each history
entry displayed by the <code>history</code> builtin. 
If this variable is set, time stamps are written to the history file so
they may be preserved across shell sessions. 
This uses the history comment character to distinguish timestamps from
other history lines.

     <br><dt><code>HOSTFILE</code><a name="index-HOSTFILE-204"></a><dd>Contains the name of a file in the same format as <samp><span class="file">/etc/hosts</span></samp> that
should be read when the shell needs to complete a hostname. 
The list of possible hostname completions may be changed while the shell
is running;
the next time hostname completion is attempted after the
value is changed, Bash adds the contents of the new file to the
existing list. 
If <samp><span class="env">HOSTFILE</span></samp> is set, but has no value, or does not name a readable file,
Bash attempts to read
<samp><span class="file">/etc/hosts</span></samp> to obtain the list of possible hostname completions. 
When <samp><span class="env">HOSTFILE</span></samp> is unset, the hostname list is cleared.

     <br><dt><code>HOSTNAME</code><a name="index-HOSTNAME-205"></a><dd>The name of the current host.

     <br><dt><code>HOSTTYPE</code><a name="index-HOSTTYPE-206"></a><dd>A string describing the machine Bash is running on.

     <br><dt><code>IGNOREEOF</code><a name="index-IGNOREEOF-207"></a><dd>Controls the action of the shell on receipt of an <code>EOF</code> character
as the sole input.  If set, the value denotes the number
of consecutive <code>EOF</code> characters that can be read as the
first character on an input line
before the shell will exit.  If the variable exists but does not
have a numeric value (or has no value) then the default is 10. 
If the variable does not exist, then <code>EOF</code> signifies the end of
input to the shell.  This is only in effect for interactive shells.

     <br><dt><code>INPUTRC</code><a name="index-INPUTRC-208"></a><dd>The name of the Readline initialization file, overriding the default
of <samp><span class="file">~/.inputrc</span></samp>.

     <br><dt><code>LANG</code><a name="index-LANG-209"></a><dd>Used to determine the locale category for any category not specifically
selected with a variable starting with <code>LC_</code>.

     <br><dt><code>LC_ALL</code><a name="index-LC_005fALL-210"></a><dd>This variable overrides the value of <samp><span class="env">LANG</span></samp> and any other
<code>LC_</code> variable specifying a locale category.

     <br><dt><code>LC_COLLATE</code><a name="index-LC_005fCOLLATE-211"></a><dd>This variable determines the collation order used when sorting the
results of filename expansion, and
determines the behavior of range expressions, equivalence classes,
and collating sequences within filename expansion and pattern matching
(see <a href="Filename-Expansion.html#Filename-Expansion">Filename Expansion</a>).

     <br><dt><code>LC_CTYPE</code><a name="index-LC_005fCTYPE-212"></a><dd>This variable determines the interpretation of characters and the
behavior of character classes within filename expansion and pattern
matching (see <a href="Filename-Expansion.html#Filename-Expansion">Filename Expansion</a>).

     <br><dt><code>LC_MESSAGES</code><a name="index-LC_005fMESSAGES-213"></a><dd>This variable determines the locale used to translate double-quoted
strings preceded by a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; (see <a href="Locale-Translation.html#Locale-Translation">Locale Translation</a>).

     <br><dt><code>LC_NUMERIC</code><a name="index-LC_005fNUMERIC-214"></a><dd>This variable determines the locale category used for number formatting.

     <br><dt><code>LINENO</code><a name="index-LINENO-215"></a><dd>The line number in the script or shell function currently executing.

     <br><dt><code>LINES</code><a name="index-LINES-216"></a><dd>Used by the <code>select</code> builtin command to determine the column length
for printing selection lists.  Automatically set upon receipt of a
<code>SIGWINCH</code>.

     <br><dt><code>MACHTYPE</code><a name="index-MACHTYPE-217"></a><dd>A string that fully describes the system type on which Bash
is executing, in the standard <span class="sc">gnu</span> <var>cpu-company-system</var> format.

     <br><dt><code>MAILCHECK</code><a name="index-MAILCHECK-218"></a><dd>How often (in seconds) that the shell should check for mail in the
files specified in the <samp><span class="env">MAILPATH</span></samp> or <samp><span class="env">MAIL</span></samp> variables. 
The default is 60 seconds.  When it is time to check
for mail, the shell does so before displaying the primary prompt. 
If this variable is unset, or set to a value that is not a number
greater than or equal to zero, the shell disables mail checking.

     <br><dt><code>OLDPWD</code><a name="index-OLDPWD-219"></a><dd>The previous working directory as set by the <code>cd</code> builtin.

     <br><dt><code>OPTERR</code><a name="index-OPTERR-220"></a><dd>If set to the value 1, Bash displays error messages
generated by the <code>getopts</code> builtin command.

     <br><dt><code>OSTYPE</code><a name="index-OSTYPE-221"></a><dd>A string describing the operating system Bash is running on.

     <br><dt><code>PIPESTATUS</code><a name="index-PIPESTATUS-222"></a><dd>An array variable (see <a href="Arrays.html#Arrays">Arrays</a>)
containing a list of exit status values from the processes
in the most-recently-executed foreground pipeline (which may
contain only a single command).

     <br><dt><code>POSIXLY_CORRECT</code><a name="index-POSIXLY_005fCORRECT-223"></a><dd>If this variable is in the environment when <code>bash</code> starts, the shell
enters <span class="sc">posix</span> mode (see <a href="Bash-POSIX-Mode.html#Bash-POSIX-Mode">Bash POSIX Mode</a>) before reading the
startup files, as if the <samp><span class="option">--posix</span></samp> invocation option had been supplied. 
If it is set while the shell is running, <code>bash</code> enables <span class="sc">posix</span> mode,
as if the command
     <pre class="example">          <code>set -o posix</code>
</pre>
     <p class="noindent">had been executed.

     <br><dt><code>PPID</code><a name="index-PPID-224"></a><dd>The process <span class="sc">id</span> of the shell's parent process.  This variable
is readonly.

     <br><dt><code>PROMPT_COMMAND</code><a name="index-PROMPT_005fCOMMAND-225"></a><dd>If set, the value is interpreted as a command to execute
before the printing of each primary prompt (<samp><span class="env">$PS1</span></samp>).

     <br><dt><code>PROMPT_DIRTRIM</code><a name="index-PROMPT_005fDIRTRIM-226"></a><dd>If set to a number greater than zero, the value is used as the number of
trailing directory components to retain when expanding the <code>\w</code> and
<code>\W</code> prompt string escapes (see <a href="Printing-a-Prompt.html#Printing-a-Prompt">Printing a Prompt</a>). 
Characters removed are replaced with an ellipsis.

     <br><dt><code>PS3</code><a name="index-PS3-227"></a><dd>The value of this variable is used as the prompt for the
<code>select</code> command.  If this variable is not set, the
<code>select</code> command prompts with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#? </span></samp>&rsquo;

     <br><dt><code>PS4</code><a name="index-PS4-228"></a><dd>The value is the prompt printed before the command line is echoed
when the <samp><span class="option">-x</span></samp> option is set (see <a href="The-Set-Builtin.html#The-Set-Builtin">The Set Builtin</a>). 
The first character of <samp><span class="env">PS4</span></samp> is replicated multiple times, as
necessary, to indicate multiple levels of indirection. 
The default is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+ </span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <br><dt><code>PWD</code><a name="index-PWD-229"></a><dd>The current working directory as set by the <code>cd</code> builtin.

     <br><dt><code>RANDOM</code><a name="index-RANDOM-230"></a><dd>Each time this parameter is referenced, a random integer
between 0 and 32767 is generated.  Assigning a value to this
variable seeds the random number generator.

     <br><dt><code>REPLY</code><a name="index-REPLY-231"></a><dd>The default variable for the <code>read</code> builtin.

     <br><dt><code>SECONDS</code><a name="index-SECONDS-232"></a><dd>This variable expands to the number of seconds since the
shell was started.  Assignment to this variable resets
the count to the value assigned, and the expanded value
becomes the value assigned plus the number of seconds
since the assignment.

     <br><dt><code>SHELL</code><a name="index-SHELL-233"></a><dd>The full pathname to the shell is kept in this environment variable. 
If it is not set when the shell starts,
Bash assigns to it the full pathname of the current user's login shell.

     <br><dt><code>SHELLOPTS</code><a name="index-SHELLOPTS-234"></a><dd>A colon-separated list of enabled shell options.  Each word in
the list is a valid argument for the <samp><span class="option">-o</span></samp> option to the
<code>set</code> builtin command (see <a href="The-Set-Builtin.html#The-Set-Builtin">The Set Builtin</a>). 
The options appearing in <samp><span class="env">SHELLOPTS</span></samp> are those reported
as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">on</span></samp>&rsquo; by &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">set -o</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
If this variable is in the environment when Bash
starts up, each shell option in the list will be enabled before
reading any startup files.  This variable is readonly.

     <br><dt><code>SHLVL</code><a name="index-SHLVL-235"></a><dd>Incremented by one each time a new instance of Bash is started.  This is
intended to be a count of how deeply your Bash shells are nested.

     <br><dt><code>TIMEFORMAT</code><a name="index-TIMEFORMAT-236"></a><dd>The value of this parameter is used as a format string specifying
how the timing information for pipelines prefixed with the <code>time</code>
reserved word should be displayed. 
The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo; character introduces an
escape sequence that is expanded to a time value or other
information. 
The escape sequences and their meanings are as
follows; the braces denote optional portions.

          <dl>
<dt><code>%%</code><dd>A literal &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">%</span></samp>&rsquo;.

          <br><dt><code>%[</code><var>p</var><code>][l]R</code><dd>The elapsed time in seconds.

          <br><dt><code>%[</code><var>p</var><code>][l]U</code><dd>The number of CPU seconds spent in user mode.

          <br><dt><code>%[</code><var>p</var><code>][l]S</code><dd>The number of CPU seconds spent in system mode.

          <br><dt><code>%P</code><dd>The CPU percentage, computed as (%U + %S) / %R. 
</dl>

     <p>The optional <var>p</var> is a digit specifying the precision, the number of
fractional digits after a decimal point. 
A value of 0 causes no decimal point or fraction to be output. 
At most three places after the decimal point may be specified; values
of <var>p</var> greater than 3 are changed to 3. 
If <var>p</var> is not specified, the value 3 is used.

     <p>The optional <code>l</code> specifies a longer format, including minutes, of
the form <var>MM</var>m<var>SS</var>.<var>FF</var>s. 
The value of <var>p</var> determines whether or not the fraction is included.

     <p>If this variable is not set, Bash acts as if it had the value
     <pre class="example">          <code>$'\nreal\t%3lR\nuser\t%3lU\nsys\t%3lS'</code>
</pre>
     <p>If the value is null, no timing information is displayed. 
A trailing newline is added when the format string is displayed.

     <br><dt><code>TMOUT</code><a name="index-TMOUT-237"></a><dd>If set to a value greater than zero, <code>TMOUT</code> is treated as the
default timeout for the <code>read</code> builtin (see <a href="Bash-Builtins.html#Bash-Builtins">Bash Builtins</a>). 
The <code>select</code> command (see <a href="Conditional-Constructs.html#Conditional-Constructs">Conditional Constructs</a>) terminates
if input does not arrive after <code>TMOUT</code> seconds when input is coming
from a terminal.

     <p>In an interactive shell, the value is interpreted as
the number of seconds to wait for input after issuing the primary
prompt when the shell is interactive. 
Bash terminates after that number of seconds if input does
not arrive.

     <br><dt><code>TMPDIR</code><a name="index-TMPDIR-238"></a><dd>If set, Bash uses its value as the name of a directory in which
Bash creates temporary files for the shell's use.

     <br><dt><code>UID</code><a name="index-UID-239"></a><dd>The numeric real user id of the current user.  This variable is readonly.

   </dl>
