How to use .bxl files :
=======================

The Ultra Librarian software is a free reader from Accelerated Designs which
allows the user to view the .bxl files. It also allows the user to create symbols
and footprints for most common CAD tools. For further information, please visit
first http://www.accelerated-designs.com/.

The process to use a .bxl file is detailed below:
1. Download and install the Ultra Librarian reader.
2. Unzip the zip filed of the desired product series.
3. Open the appropriate .bxl ( the Ultra Librarian software will open automatically).
4. Export the file to the desired PCB/CAD format.

The package contains :
   + A .bxl file for each STM32F4x device or generic sub-family (x) in the different existing packages
	  o Check your device part number and select it from the list
   + A .xlsx file containing the correspondance between part number and .bxl file
